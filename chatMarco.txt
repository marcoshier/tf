12/29/18, 14:07 - Marco: Hey Lorenzo, I wanted to ask you if you know the procedure for the insurance to pay for repairing my computer. When it dropped to the floor from the table the case broke and it's not attached anymore. The computer still works perfectly but I'm afraid that leaving the components exposed will lead them to degrade quickly and I want to avoid that since it's a new laptop. At first it was a little open but now it's cracking more and I don't want the inside components to be damaged by that. Of course I'm not angry or anything haha, don't worry at all, I just wanted to know if you already know the procedure and if we can figure it out after the collectives maybe? Cause I'll need the computer for those
12/29/18, 14:12 - Marco: Is it a big trouble?
12/29/18, 14:13 - Marco: I really hope not
12/29/18, 14:15 - Marco: Yes I do
12/29/18, 14:16 - Marco: No it's a clevo
12/29/18, 14:16 - Marco: I think that's the most troubling thing
12/29/18, 14:16 - Marco: Because
12/29/18, 14:17 - Marco: To be repaired without losing the warranty I have to send it in portugal
12/29/18, 14:17 - Marco: Yes it's not a commercial brand
12/29/18, 14:17 - Marco: You don't have to rush
12/29/18, 14:17 - Marco: We can talk about it when we get back tos chool
12/29/18, 14:17 - Marco: Just wanted to let you know
12/29/18, 14:18 - Marco: Since I just got back in Den Haag
12/29/18, 14:19 - Marco: Unfortunately the computer is made in really shitty plastic and I hate it for that
12/29/18, 14:19 - Marco: I wouldn't have bothered you at all otherwise, but I know it's most likely gonna get worse for that haha
12/29/18, 14:22 - Marco: Yeah of course
12/29/18, 14:23 - Marco: I don't even know how much will the repairing cost because I have to send it first and then they will tell me
12/29/18, 14:23 - Marco: Okk but doesn't my liability insurance cover the damage I make for other people's things?
12/29/18, 14:23 - Marco: I will check it anyway ofc
12/29/18, 14:24 - Marco: Okk I'll check at the end of the holidays
12/29/18, 14:24 - Marco: I'll call the insurance company directly
12/29/18, 14:25 - Marco: Okok I just thought you knew because you have this kind of insurance here and we have nothing like that in italy so I have no idea how it works haha
12/29/18, 14:25 - Marco: Do you think it's a problem if I send it after the collectives?
12/29/18, 14:26 - Marco: Ok but you don't have to right now
12/29/18, 14:26 - Marco: Do it when you have time, don't bother too much unless waiting is a problem for the insurance
12/29/18, 14:27 - Marco: Okok
12/29/18, 14:28 - Marco: Yeah 25 thousands covers the entire cost of the laptop 25 times lol
12/29/18, 14:33 - Marco: Okay
12/29/18, 14:34 - Marco: Please remember to ask them if it's a problem to wait until 21 before sending it
12/29/18, 14:34 - Marco: Ahahahahah
12/29/18, 14:34 - Marco: Yeah the day of the collectives
12/29/18, 14:35 - Marco: (No?)
12/29/18, 14:35 - Marco: Okok good

1/4/19, 14:35 - Marco: Ok no problem
1/4/19, 14:37 - Marco: What you've done is already a lot! Don't worry about it
1/4/19, 14:37 - Marco: I'll figure it out

5/6/19, 19:24 - Marco: Depends on how you dealt with it
5/6/19, 19:24 - Marco: Going to school during the break was useful for me
5/6/19, 19:28 - Marco: Yeah I can understand, also because you put much more effort than me during the rest of the year so the same solution doesnt necessarily relate to you
5/6/19, 19:48 - Marco: Ahahahahahahahah
5/6/19, 19:58 - Lorenzo: Marco
5/6/19, 19:58 - Marco: Ofc

5/7/19, 07:26 - Marco: Exactly
5/7/19, 08:39 - Marco: Yeah me too, that's why I asked you about it some time ago
5/7/19, 08:42 - Marco: But where do I start to research it from
5/7/19, 08:42 - Marco: And is it the same if I do it like with an app or should I go more for something like a 10 days thing like jereone said
5/7/19, 08:42 - Marco: Okk

5/9/19, 21:31 - Marco: See later
5/12/19, 19:33 - Marco: No I don't think so
5/12/19, 19:33 - Marco: This thing of first version second version he only said it for one assignment

5/12/19, 21:02 - Marco: But I was very proud of the last one
5/12/19, 21:02 - Marco: And I'm putting less effort on this one so I know it won't be as good
5/12/19, 21:02 - Marco: Hahahah really
5/12/19, 21:03 - Marco: Wow
5/12/19, 21:03 - Marco: I was very heartwarmed when he asked to roll it twice hahah
5/12/19, 21:05 - Marco: Hahahahah
5/13/19, 22:30 - Marco: <Media omitted>
5/13/19, 22:34 - Marco: Ahahahahah

5/15/19, 17:56 - Marco: 70x100
5/15/19, 17:56 - Marco: Right?
5/15/19, 18:00 - Marco: And how many we need?
5/15/19, 18:00 - Marco: 10?

5/15/19, 21:49 - Marco: Yeah I've seen
5/15/19, 21:50 - Marco: But I mean
5/15/19, 21:50 - Marco: We also have to show the first ones
5/15/19, 21:50 - Marco: Ok good
5/15/19, 21:51 - Marco: And do you think the presentation of the process should be as visual as the first one
5/15/19, 21:51 - Marco: Idk I think the research is interesting
5/15/19, 21:51 - Marco: But paradoxically I found out that I can connect concepts better with words
5/15/19, 21:51 - Marco: Like
5/15/19, 21:52 - Marco: To make my ideas clear on a paper
5/15/19, 21:52 - Marco: I don't know if that's a good thing in an art school haha
5/15/19, 21:52 - Marco: But for now I'm finding that more helpful in getting ahead with a concept
5/15/19, 21:52 - Marco: Hahahah I can write it simpler if you want

5/22/19, 10:29 - Marco: I think 60
5/22/19, 10:47 - Marco: the problem with lofi music is that you're never really sure if the song is like that or the headphones fucked up lol
5/22/19, 10:48 - Marco: yeah every distortion effect
5/22/19, 22:32 - Marco: Nice
5/22/19, 22:32 - Marco: Bass is a fucking nice instrument
5/22/19, 22:32 - Marco: Jaaa pls
5/22/19, 22:50 - Marco: Wooooow it looks greattt
5/22/19, 22:50 - Marco: Semiautomatic haha
5/22/19, 22:50 - Marco: Yeah I also prefer it acoustic
5/22/19, 22:51 - Marco: Idk it gives more of a raw feeling
5/22/19, 22:51 - Marco: But also depends on what you want to tplay
5/22/19, 22:51 - Marco: At the end you should've said "smash like and subscribe"
5/22/19, 22:52 - Marco: I'd kill for a guitar haha
5/22/19, 22:52 - Marco: You dont have a good one?
5/22/19, 22:52 - Marco: Or you dont have one at all
5/22/19, 22:55 - Marco: What doesnt work
5/22/19, 22:59 - Marco: I don't think it's something difficult to solve at all
5/22/19, 22:59 - Marco: But I might be mistaken
5/22/19, 23:00 - Marco: Oh then that's why
5/22/19, 23:05 - Marco: I'm thinking about buying a guitar from there
5/22/19, 23:05 - Marco: You think it's a good idea
5/22/19, 23:05 - Marco: No, really didn't have any mindspace for politics lately
5/22/19, 23:05 - Marco: You
5/22/19, 23:05 - Marco: On
5/22/19, 23:06 - Marco: Yeah cause that's what I am
5/22/19, 23:06 - Marco: A starter
5/22/19, 23:06 - Marco: :(
5/22/19, 23:06 - Marco: No yeah btw
5/22/19, 23:07 - Marco: But as good as I can get it
5/22/19, 23:07 - Marco: For like 60 euros
5/22/19, 23:07 - Marco: I probably can just get a crappy one
5/22/19, 23:07 - Marco: I think so, it's easier for me
5/22/19, 23:07 - Marco: You think I should be going for classic
5/22/19, 23:07 - Marco: Western
5/22/19, 23:08 - Marco: Hahaha spanish culture is something I really can't stand that much
5/22/19, 23:08 - Marco: And sounds and most things about spain
5/22/19, 23:08 - Marco: Just don't vibe with it
5/22/19, 23:08 - Marco: So if the sound really recalls that kind of thing
5/22/19, 23:09 - Marco: I won't go for that
5/22/19, 23:09 - Marco: Neee not my stuff
5/22/19, 23:11 - Marco: Oh finally
5/22/19, 23:11 - Marco: Someone says it
5/22/19, 23:11 - Marco: Damnnn
5/22/19, 23:11 - Marco: I dunno maybe I have to research on it
5/22/19, 23:12 - Marco: But so spanish and western are two types of acoustic
5/22/19, 23:12 - Marco: Ok
5/22/19, 23:12 - Marco: And starting with acoustic or classic doesnt matter, or do you recommend either one
5/22/19, 23:12 - Marco: Eh blues
5/22/19, 23:13 - Marco: Yeah I know
5/22/19, 23:13 - Marco: I tried both
5/22/19, 23:13 - Marco: And classic was so difficult for me
5/22/19, 23:13 - Marco: Painful to play at some point
5/22/19, 23:13 - Marco: Hahahah
5/22/19, 23:13 - Marco: I will also do my research
5/22/19, 23:14 - Marco: But last question, what decent brand do you think I can find for that price range
5/22/19, 23:14 - Marco: I think eko
5/22/19, 23:14 - Marco: Probably ibanez, no?
5/22/19, 23:14 - Marco: Who of the two
5/22/19, 23:17 - Marco: Okk I will search tomorrow
5/22/19, 23:18 - Marco: Yeah I know, I read "elitist cunt' and I wasn't sure about who of the two you were referring two
5/22/19, 23:18 - Marco: Then I read again
5/22/19, 23:21 - Marco: I feel you
5/22/19, 23:23 - Marco: Oh but you didnt mean european elections
5/22/19, 23:23 - Marco: Or did you
5/22/19, 23:24 - Marco: Oh om
5/22/19, 23:24 - Marco: Ok*

5/22/19, 23:24 - Marco: Yeah like the groenen
5/22/19, 23:25 - Marco: Cause they have them in almost every country I thibk
5/22/19, 23:26 - Marco: Hahahah
5/22/19, 23:26 - Marco: I thought at least in the netherlands they would be a bit more relevant
5/22/19, 23:29 - Marco: Are they a good party here
5/22/19, 23:34 - Marco: In italy it almost doesnt exist
5/22/19, 23:47 - Marco: Hahahah so much willpower

6/7/19, 21:28 - Marco: I mean my computer desktop
6/7/19, 21:28 - Marco: Then I'm gonna recheck Raymond's videos and upload them
6/7/19, 21:28 - Marco: Then work on the visual for the self-portrait/collective
6/7/19, 21:32 - Marco: Yeah but the upload protocols they use are not from google so it really depends on how good is the work that the browser developers do
6/7/19, 21:32 - Marco: And firefox's developers are way better
6/7/19, 21:33 - Marco: Not at all
6/7/19, 21:34 - Marco: I would do so as well cause in the whole week I slept 10 hours total

6/9/19, 23:14 - Marco: But btw I was talking about songs like ragga bomb
6/9/19, 23:14 - Marco: Which is kinda experimental for what he did, kinda not for dubstep maybe
6/9/19, 23:15 - Marco: But was kind of innovative in my opinion
6/9/19, 23:15 - Marco: I also really like bad man
6/9/19, 23:15 - Marco: With ragga twins

8/5/19, 23:14 - Marco: I wanna learn music theory cause everyone told me that it levels up your way of playing a lot

8/5/19, 23:32 - Marco: Never seen that before
8/5/19, 23:32 - Marco: That's amazing
8/5/19, 23:33 - Marco: That's a nice concept
8/5/19, 23:34 - Marco: All the concerts should be like this
8/5/19, 23:34 - Marco: With bands mainly

8/5/19, 23:56 - Marco: If I went to one
8/6/19, 00:04 - Marco: I imagine
8/6/19, 00:06 - Marco: Hahahah yeah
8/6/19, 00:06 - Marco: Don't forget to mention international
8/6/19, 00:09 - Marco: Hahahaah reallyyy
8/6/19, 00:09 - Marco: Wtff
8/6/19, 00:12 - Marco: Can you recommend me a film
8/6/19, 00:24 - Marco: Not comedy
8/6/19, 00:24 - Marco: Something serious
8/6/19, 00:24 - Marco: That gives ispirations
8/6/19, 00:25 - Marco: Like nice visuals and stuff
8/6/19, 00:26 - Marco: Sounds nice
8/6/19, 00:26 - Marco: Is it horror
8/6/19, 00:27 - Marco: The fountain is from aronofsky(?)
8/6/19, 00:27 - Marco: What about the fountain
8/6/19, 00:27 - Marco: Ok i didnt watch it yet
8/6/19, 00:27 - Marco: So that is for reminding me that it exists haha
8/6/19, 10:01 - Marco: It was nice but also mind blowing haha
8/6/19, 10:32 - Marco: Ja
8/6/19, 10:32 - Marco: The scene where plants grow out of the guy
8/6/19, 10:32 - Marco: Disturbing
8/6/19, 10:32 - Marco: It was a good film but I'm not sure I caught all the meanings tbh
8/6/19, 11:26 - Marco: No I kind of got the general meaning and some specific things too
8/6/19, 11:26 - Marco: But I feel like I've left something behind for sure
8/6/19, 11:26 - Marco: Idk I've never actually seen that
8/6/19, 11:27 - Marco: And it's quite disturbing to me having something growing in and out of your body at a great pace while you're alive and aware and have no control over it
8/6/19, 11:27 - Marco: Yeah, and I'm not sure I fully understood the connection between them
8/6/19, 11:28 - Marco: Or I mean
8/6/19, 11:28 - Marco: I do, but I'm not sure if there is some more to it that I didn't see
8/6/19, 11:28 - Marco: Yeah actually
8/6/19, 11:50 - Marco: Yeah it kind of connects
8/6/19, 14:31 - Marco: Ahahahahah
8/6/19, 21:22 - Marco: 217 euros? Wow
8/6/19, 21:23 - Marco: Hahah nice comparison with the hobbit
8/6/19, 21:27 - Marco: Jesus
8/6/19, 21:28 - Marco: Straight to hell haha
8/12/19, 11:42 - Marco: Yeah nice design

8/22/19, 15:08 - Marco: Oh the charcoal?
8/22/19, 15:22 - Marco: It's very 'dynamic' shapes, like idk if you ever saw me tagging (all the time)
8/22/19, 15:23 - Marco: I do it cause I like how dynamic the shapes are with a quick line
8/22/19, 15:23 - Marco: Yeah I see life kind of
8/22/19, 15:23 - Marco: It's difficult to explain haha
8/22/19, 15:23 - Marco: In my head it's very clear but can't really put it into words
8/22/19, 15:24 - Marco: And also your drawing has kind of a dark vibe
8/22/19, 15:24 - Marco: I like it
8/22/19, 15:24 - Marco: They look like insects, are they?
8/22/19, 15:25 - Marco: Why is your mindset dark
8/22/19, 17:44 - Marco: Hahah i did nothing almost
8/22/19, 17:44 - Marco: Apart from the photos
8/22/19, 21:03 - Marco: That's nice
8/22/19, 21:03 - Marco: I'm going out of the city on my bike for that

8/22/19, 22:33 - Marco: So on the beach
8/22/19, 22:34 - Marco: Tbh I'm all about little towns or places where there is peace quiet and I can say "wow" about whatever I see because everything is so peaceful and quiet and traditional
8/22/19, 22:34 - Marco: Like I'm all about that shit
8/22/19, 22:35 - Marco: I wanna go the extra mile to find a cool place to sit relax smoke a joint and read

8/29/19, 17:16 - Marco: Very, hopefully
8/29/19, 17:16 - Marco: I'm gonna mind my own business much more
8/29/19, 17:16 - Marco: I can hear your voice
8/29/19, 17:19 - Marco: Ahahahahahah
8/29/19, 17:20 - Marco: Not nick right
8/29/19, 17:20 - Marco: Hahahah
8/29/19, 18:02 - Marco: <Media omitted>
8/29/19, 18:03 - Marco: <Media omitted>
8/29/19, 18:41 - Marco: Yeah for a
8/29/19, 18:42 - Marco: Pakket
8/29/19, 18:42 - Marco: But it was closed why
8/29/19, 18:44 - Marco: It was closed, whyyyyyy
8/29/19, 18:46 - Marco: Exactly
8/29/19, 18:50 - Marco: Sounds fucking great
8/29/19, 18:50 - Marco: I would sample it
8/29/19, 18:52 - Marco: Not really, let me hear it again
8/29/19, 18:53 - Marco: Yeah it resonates but I'm not sure
8/29/19, 18:53 - Marco: Yeah that one
8/29/19, 18:53 - Marco: It sounds very familiar
8/29/19, 18:55 - Marco: I knew the song but not the title and who made it
8/30/19, 22:18 - Marco: <Media omitted>
8/30/19, 22:20 - Marco: <Media omitted>
8/30/19, 23:17 - Marco: Yeah I'm also looking forward to that, hoping that it doesn't end up like with Eva
8/30/19, 23:19 - Marco: Idk but I don't think the class was very welcoming with her
8/30/19, 23:19 - Marco: Including me
8/30/19, 23:19 - Marco: We treated her a bit like the new kid in elementary school I feeli like
8/30/19, 23:19 - Marco: Feel like
8/30/19, 23:19 - Marco: No one showed themselves half as enthusiast to have her in class
8/30/19, 23:24 - Marco: 100% truth
8/30/19, 23:24 - Marco: How can you stand that
8/30/19, 23:25 - Marco: Like the forced kind of attitude sometimes
8/30/19, 23:25 - Marco: I really really really hate that
8/30/19, 23:25 - Marco: In everyone
8/30/19, 23:25 - Marco: Not only our class
8/30/19, 23:25 - Marco: Everyone in my life
8/30/19, 23:25 - Marco: Really how do you cope w that
8/30/19, 23:25 - Marco: Because I can't
8/30/19, 23:26 - Marco: That many things and behaviours in our class are forced
8/30/19, 23:26 - Marco: Yeah
8/30/19, 23:26 - Marco: The birthdays is only one example
8/30/19, 23:26 - Marco: Big example
8/30/19, 23:26 - Marco: But yeah thay
8/30/19, 23:26 - Marco: That
8/30/19, 23:26 - Marco: I really don't know how to deal with ir
8/30/19, 23:26 - Marco: It
8/30/19, 23:27 - Marco: Never had that back in italy
8/30/19, 23:28 - Marco: Yeah it was something at the start but then it faded away
8/30/19, 23:28 - Marco: Yeah my bday too
8/30/19, 23:28 - Marco: Because people realized how blatantly forced it is
8/30/19, 23:28 - Marco: I know but are you fine with that?
8/30/19, 23:29 - Marco: Hahaha yeah it's messed up
8/30/19, 23:29 - Marco: Echt fucktup
8/30/19, 23:29 - Marco: Ahahah yeah me too
8/30/19, 23:29 - Marco: I asked myself since the start
8/30/19, 23:30 - Marco: "Are they really gonna do this for everyone until the fucking last day of the year?"
8/30/19, 23:30 - Marco: And I knew the answer already
8/30/19, 23:30 - Marco: Yeah but I think his intention was kind of pure
8/30/19, 23:30 - Marco: You can I don't mind
8/30/19, 23:30 - Marco: Yeah
8/30/19, 23:31 - Marco: The tunnel bs
8/30/19, 23:31 - Marco: Yeah I hated that project
8/30/19, 23:31 - Marco: From the presentation to the end
8/30/19, 23:31 - Marco: Puppy eyes is an accurate description hahaha
8/30/19, 23:31 - Marco: It instantly gave me an accurate image of that moment
8/30/19, 23:31 - Marco: That I had buried
8/30/19, 23:31 - Marco: Deep
8/30/19, 23:32 - Marco: Hahahaha
8/30/19, 23:32 - Marco: But no I like jeroen
8/30/19, 23:32 - Marco: He may be saying a lot of bs but he is truly positive (not always truly but more than many others) and has very good qualities that I appreciatw
8/30/19, 23:33 - Marco: Uhm
8/30/19, 23:33 - Marco: I find everyone kind of annoying sometimes, but not only class
8/30/19, 23:33 - Marco: Like everyone
8/30/19, 23:33 - Marco: Absolute
8/30/19, 23:33 - Marco: But really maybee
8/30/19, 23:33 - Marco: Idk
8/30/19, 23:34 - Marco: There is really no one in that class that really makes me fucking annoyed
8/30/19, 23:34 - Marco: There used to be
8/30/19, 23:34 - Marco: But now idc anymore
8/30/19, 23:34 - Marco: During this summer I've learned to not let people affect me too much negatively
8/30/19, 23:35 - Marco: I can relate
8/30/19, 23:35 - Marco: Which is why I can't really answer your question
8/30/19, 23:35 - Marco: Wdym
8/30/19, 23:35 - Marco: Yeah
8/30/19, 23:36 - Marco: :P
8/30/19, 23:36 - Marco: This question
8/30/19, 23:36 - Marco: Oh
8/30/19, 23:36 - Marco: Hahahah
8/30/19, 23:36 - Marco: Soz
8/30/19, 23:36 - Marco: What does echt mean btw
8/30/19, 23:37 - Marco: I'm hearing it all the time
8/30/19, 23:37 - Marco: Jesus fuck haha
8/30/19, 23:37 - Marco: I may have heard it 100 times in the past week
8/30/19, 23:37 - Marco: Yeah
8/30/19, 23:37 - Marco: But anyway
8/30/19, 23:37 - Marco: Going back to that topic
8/30/19, 23:38 - Marco: You're gonna see many differences on who I will be with and how I will interact with people this year
8/30/19, 23:38 - Marco: I hope
8/30/19, 23:39 - Marco: No that's what I did last year
8/30/19, 23:39 - Marco: Until last year
8/30/19, 23:39 - Marco: I really morphed my personality to appeal to people who then turned out to be toxic or not worth my attention at all
8/30/19, 23:40 - Marco: And I'm veryvery done with that
8/30/19, 23:40 - Marco: Cringe
8/30/19, 23:40 - Marco: Like what
8/30/19, 23:40 - Marco: In general but you know who I passed most of my time with
8/30/19, 23:41 - Marco: Ahahahahah
8/30/19, 23:41 - Marco: Not only
8/30/19, 23:42 - Marco: Imagine that
8/30/19, 23:42 - Marco: But with wies I honestly kind of knew since the start that we were not really meant to be friends
8/30/19, 23:42 - Marco: I mean we really think alike many times
8/30/19, 23:43 - Marco: But I also sometimes changed the way I think to keep up this illusion that we think alike
8/30/19, 23:43 - Marco: And I kind of wanted to challenge myself to be friends with people that are totally out of my comfort zone
8/30/19, 23:43 - Marco: But I went too far
8/30/19, 23:43 - Marco: Yeah I know I've learned a lot
8/30/19, 23:44 - Marco: Including that they are not my type of people
8/30/19, 23:44 - Marco: And I'm not their type of people apparently
8/30/19, 23:45 - Marco: Yeah I understand
8/30/19, 23:46 - Marco: I didn't even have such meaningful connections back in italy
8/30/19, 23:46 - Marco: So it was really new for me everything
8/30/19, 23:46 - Marco: For you maybe not because you've been here your whole life
8/30/19, 23:46 - Marco: 10.847
8/30/19, 23:46 - Marco: 21
8/30/19, 23:47 - Marco: Ahahah int0rwebz
8/30/19, 23:47 - Marco: Took a while
8/30/19, 23:48 - Marco: Yeah that's cool thay you have that
8/30/19, 23:48 - Marco: But I know I will also find these people
8/30/19, 23:48 - Marco: But this summer I learned to appreciate being alone
8/30/19, 23:48 - Marco: Like to actually appreciate it
8/30/19, 23:48 - Marco: I know
8/30/19, 23:48 - Marco: And this is the first step for thay
8/30/19, 23:49 - Marco: I have one person
8/30/19, 23:49 - Marco: This friend of mine from germany you know
8/30/19, 23:49 - Marco: I've been friends with her for 7 years now
8/30/19, 23:49 - Marco: Nothing changed
8/30/19, 23:49 - Marco: Hahah I wish
8/30/19, 23:49 - Marco: There is this friend that I always say that comes from germany here to visit me
8/30/19, 23:49 - Marco: Hahah
8/30/19, 23:50 - Marco: She's been my best friend for years and I didn't look for her
8/30/19, 23:50 - Marco: She just texted me out of chance for a math thing or something
8/30/19, 23:51 - Marco: I know it's like thay but it's also very difficult for people to appreciate being with you if you don't like being on your own
8/30/19, 23:51 - Marco: That's very stereotypical but true
8/30/19, 23:51 - Marco: Ahahah I didn't get it but it made me laugh
8/30/19, 23:51 - Marco: Yeah it's not really clear
8/30/19, 23:51 - Marco: Basically it's
8/30/19, 23:51 - Marco: "No one will love you if you don't love yourself"
8/30/19, 23:52 - Marco: Only I wanted to say it in a different way
8/30/19, 23:52 - Marco: Cause I hate that everyone says this
8/30/19, 23:52 - Marco: But this summer I started actually having fun on my own for the first time (sounds really equivocal)
8/30/19, 23:52 - Marco: But for real
8/30/19, 23:52 - Marco: I never had that before
8/30/19, 23:53 - Marco: I didn't think you could feel happy alone but you can
8/30/19, 23:53 - Marco: Maybe you can't forever but no one is gonna be alone forever
8/30/19, 23:53 - Marco: Unless they retire in a cave or smth
8/30/19, 23:54 - Marco: I think I have the same
8/30/19, 23:54 - Marco: But is it working out for you?
8/30/19, 23:54 - Marco: Like are you making progress with that
8/30/19, 23:54 - Marco: Ok
8/30/19, 23:54 - Marco: Same but I think I got pretty far in the process
8/30/19, 23:55 - Marco: Accept it
8/30/19, 23:55 - Marco: Yeah ofc
8/30/19, 23:56 - Marco: So you gotta accept that is there and not let it condition your light instead
8/30/19, 23:56 - Marco: Yeah no i don't mean it like thay
8/30/19, 23:56 - Marco: That
8/30/19, 23:56 - Marco: Lost in translation you know
8/30/19, 23:56 - Marco: Yeah going through it without letting it overwhelm you
8/30/19, 23:57 - Marco: Right on
8/30/19, 23:57 - Marco: I-m very curious on how they will act at school
8/30/19, 23:57 - Marco: Wies and roberto i mean
8/30/19, 23:57 - Marco: Towards me
8/30/19, 23:57 - Marco: Yeah like behave
8/30/19, 23:58 - Marco: Not really different in their case I'm afraid
8/30/19, 23:58 - Marco: But don't wanna talk shit about them
8/30/19, 23:58 - Marco: Very difficult for me but I should control myself on that
8/30/19, 23:58 - Marco: _proceeds to put them in bad light to everyone in class_
8/30/19, 23:59 - Marco: It's out of tune when it sings bad things about other people
8/30/19, 23:59 - Marco: Nah
8/30/19, 23:59 - Marco: I don't think talking shit about them makes me any better
8/31/19, 00:00 - Marco: Yeah but if I talk about them now I talk shit about them
8/31/19, 00:00 - Marco: But later in time maybe
8/31/19, 00:00 - Marco: To be honest
8/31/19, 00:00 - Marco: I will gladly wait for the satisfaction of everyone realizing with their own eyes the true people they are
8/31/19, 00:01 - Marco: And if that doesn't happen so be it
8/31/19, 00:01 - Marco: If it happens then maybe everyone will make them notice and they will realize that they have to change something in themselves
8/31/19, 00:01 - Marco: Me too
8/31/19, 00:02 - Marco: But apparently that's not the case in the other way round
8/31/19, 00:02 - Marco: Sure
8/31/19, 00:03 - Marco: Hahahajajaha
8/31/19, 00:03 - Marco: Jeezus
8/31/19, 00:03 - Marco: Hahahah
8/31/19, 00:03 - Marco: Why you didnt like her
8/31/19, 00:03 - Marco: Ok you're not very compatinle
8/31/19, 00:03 - Marco: Ble
8/31/19, 00:03 - Marco: For sure
8/31/19, 00:03 - Marco: But she was like an extremist version of jeroen
8/31/19, 00:04 - Marco: And I mean extremist
8/31/19, 00:04 - Marco: Like al qaeda shit
8/31/19, 00:04 - Marco: Fuckin Hezbollah
8/31/19, 00:04 - Marco: But she had 50% of the energy of the whole class
8/31/19, 00:05 - Marco: Well I don't know no respectful terrorists
8/31/19, 00:05 - Marco: Yeah but also electronics with pedro
8/31/19, 00:06 - Marco: Very peculiar moment of our class's history
8/31/19, 00:06 - Marco: Yeah well
8/31/19, 00:06 - Marco: She had so much energy she failed to contain it
8/31/19, 00:06 - Marco: And sometimes burned other people with it
8/31/19, 00:06 - Marco: Very badly worded but makes sense in my head
8/31/19, 00:10 - Marco: Yeah she really had a problem controlling her energy
8/31/19, 00:10 - Marco: For me it was fun cause for the first time I wasnt the most anxious in the group
8/31/19, 00:11 - Marco: For the first time I saw myself telling someone else to calm down and that it wasnt that bad
8/31/19, 00:11 - Marco: But ok
8/31/19, 00:11 - Marco: This joint is waiting for me
8/31/19, 00:11 - Marco: Very curious on how the class dynamics will be from next week on
8/31/19, 00:12 - Marco: You deleted this message
8/31/19, 00:12 - Marco: Hahahah embarassing
8/31/19, 00:12 - Marco: It's the joint smoking gesture we always make
8/31/19, 00:12 - Marco: I'm not flexing or anything ofc
8/31/19, 00:13 - Marco: Hahahahahaha
8/31/19, 00:13 - Marco: A disgrace
8/31/19, 00:13 - Marco: Wait
8/31/19, 00:13 - Marco: This
8/31/19, 00:13 - Marco: I wanted to take a photo of thay
8/31/19, 00:13 - Marco: That
8/31/19, 00:14 - Marco: Hahaha yeah
8/31/19, 00:14 - Marco: When johan saw you
8/31/19, 00:14 - Marco: I was dying
8/31/19, 00:14 - Marco: So funny that he got on with it
8/31/19, 00:14 - Marco: Like he laughed at that too
8/31/19, 00:15 - Marco: You think he wouldn't have with someone else?
8/31/19, 00:15 - Marco: Of our class
8/31/19, 00:15 - Marco: No one would have had the balls to try
8/31/19, 00:15 - Marco: Probz
8/31/19, 00:15 - Marco: But also you didnt expect to be seen
8/31/19, 00:15 - Marco: Hehe
8/31/19, 00:16 - Marco: I would also do that if I didnt expect to be seen
8/31/19, 00:16 - Marco: But in that moment it was funny regardless of johan seeing you
8/31/19, 00:16 - Marco: He was just the cherry on the top
8/31/19, 00:16 - Marco: Which his head resembles very much
8/31/19, 00:16 - Marco: See
8/31/19, 00:16 - Marco: Ahahahaha
8/31/19, 00:17 - Marco: Hey johan, you're balls
8/31/19, 00:17 - Marco: Can't imagine him doing it
8/31/19, 00:17 - Marco: Ahahahahah
8/31/19, 00:17 - Marco: Ahahahahaha
8/31/19, 00:17 - Marco: Omg
8/31/19, 00:17 - Marco: Strike
8/31/19, 00:18 - Marco: Are you nuts
8/31/19, 00:19 - Marco: <Media omitted>
8/31/19, 00:19 - Marco: My dream
8/31/19, 00:19 - Marco: It's at subway
8/31/19, 00:19 - Marco: The cookies they sell at subway
8/31/19, 00:20 - Marco: You know pretty well what my job is
8/31/19, 00:20 - Marco: Now I have another one too
8/31/19, 00:20 - Marco: In an italian restaurant
8/31/19, 00:20 - Marco: You know burrata
8/31/19, 00:20 - Marco: Is close to our school
8/31/19, 00:20 - Marco: Hahaha

9/2/19, 19:40 - Marco: But we didnt do much

9/4/19, 22:38 - Marco: And you already have some skill in making games
9/4/19, 22:46 - Marco: I cant find where to register to the ist

9/6/19, 19:54 - Marco: No
9/6/19, 19:54 - Marco: Thursday right
9/6/19, 19:55 - Marco: One of the teacher talked about going to amsterdam
9/6/19, 19:55 - Marco: Right
9/6/19, 19:55 - Marco: Is it next week?
9/6/19, 19:55 - Marco: Ok
9/6/19, 19:56 - Marco: Okok don't worry
9/6/19, 19:56 - Marco: Oh ok
9/7/19, 01:09 - Marco: ❤❤❤
9/7/19, 23:12 - Marco: 808s is not hip hop
9/7/19, 23:12 - Marco: Hip hop has way harsher sounds
9/7/19, 23:12 - Marco: Boom bap they're called
9/7/19, 23:12 - Marco: 808 is used in early electronic and trap as far as i know
9/7/19, 23:13 - Marco: Boom bap is for the old school hip hop
9/7/19, 23:13 - Marco: I'm talking stuff like tribe, mos def, mobb deep ecc.
9/7/19, 23:13 - Marco: Yeah
9/7/19, 23:13 - Marco: That's what I listen to and think "hip hop"
9/7/19, 23:14 - Marco: Not some skepta or asap rocky or whatever other black guy who wants to look badass does
9/7/19, 23:15 - Marco: So distant they don't see each other almost
9/7/19, 23:15 - Marco: I believe there is a difference between hip hop and rap
9/7/19, 23:15 - Marco: That they are very intertwined but not the same thing
9/7/19, 23:15 - Marco: And this is rap
9/7/19, 23:17 - Marco: Hahaha what's up with this video
9/7/19, 23:17 - Marco: Adobe flash
9/7/19, 23:17 - Marco: But what's the point you wanna put across with this song
9/8/19, 10:27 - Marco: Yeah I didn't mean to create any, but we were talking about drake and how drake is not hip hop
9/8/19, 10:27 - Marco: He is very influenced by rap for sure
9/8/19, 10:27 - Marco: But he really has kind of his own genre i feel like
9/8/19, 10:28 - Marco: When you hear a song from drake you understand it's from drake without necessarily knowing it
9/8/19, 10:28 - Marco: And it's very remarkable considering that his songs can be very different from one another
9/8/19, 10:28 - Marco: And he really pushes the boundaries of this pop/rap genre like no other mainstream artist does i feel like
9/8/19, 10:29 - Marco: I dont vibe with it but i gotta admit he has more of a charisma in a way
9/8/19, 10:29 - Marco: He always looks like the guy that knows what he's doing
9/8/19, 10:29 - Marco: And he does
9/8/19, 10:30 - Marco: From a producer standpoint, his music is on a really high level compares to most of the rest of the genre today
9/8/19, 10:31 - Marco: Yeah i get it
9/8/19, 10:31 - Marco: I can understand that it's really not your stile
9/8/19, 10:31 - Marco: Style
9/8/19, 10:31 - Marco: Yeah that's understandable
9/8/19, 10:32 - Marco: But a lot of people, and I wont make names but they say that drake is too mainstream and his music is all the same just to hate on him
9/8/19, 10:32 - Marco: Cause he's famous and all
9/8/19, 10:32 - Marco: And "you gotta act alternative in this world of sheeps" you kno
9/8/19, 10:32 - Marco: So they just hate on him for the sake of it
9/8/19, 10:32 - Marco: Which one
9/8/19, 10:32 - Marco: Oh
9/8/19, 10:32 - Marco: Sicko mode
9/8/19, 10:33 - Marco: That song is also crazy to me
9/8/19, 10:33 - Marco: Oh
9/8/19, 10:33 - Marco: Then idk he has many
9/8/19, 10:33 - Marco: Let me listen to it
9/8/19, 10:38 - Marco: No I also dont know
9/8/19, 10:39 - Marco: Yeah maybe he does that but I feel like it's on purpose
9/8/19, 10:39 - Marco: Because he can rap
9/8/19, 10:39 - Marco: He has flow even if the lyrics sometimes lack content
9/8/19, 10:39 - Marco: Most of the times actually
9/8/19, 10:39 - Marco: But again, I watch drake from more of a producer standpoint
9/8/19, 10:41 - Marco: I never listened to the early drake, like before 2013
9/8/19, 10:42 - Marco: Like a couple songs but he sounds like something completely different
9/8/19, 10:42 - Marco: From 2013 on I feel like he has assumed more of a solidified identity
9/8/19, 10:42 - Marco: Over?
9/8/19, 10:42 - Marco: Over is not after 2013
9/8/19, 10:42 - Marco: Oh
9/8/19, 10:43 - Marco: Oooh hahah
9/8/19, 10:43 - Marco: Ok let me think
9/8/19, 10:43 - Marco: No idk
9/8/19, 10:44 - Marco: But to summarize what my opinion of drake is in one sentence
9/8/19, 10:44 - Marco: I think what he does always defines the present and gives a glimpse of the future
9/8/19, 10:44 - Marco: That's what I think
9/8/19, 10:49 - Marco: Yeah exactly
9/8/19, 10:50 - Marco: No
9/8/19, 10:50 - Marco: Drake is the hype
9/8/19, 10:50 - Marco: Hahaha
9/8/19, 10:50 - Marco: Ok
9/8/19, 10:51 - Marco: I know I was exagerating
9/8/19, 10:51 - Marco: But yeah I mean that he's almost in control of the hype
9/8/19, 10:52 - Marco: He decides what is hype or not almost
9/8/19, 10:52 - Marco: But also
9/8/19, 10:52 - Marco: About the people that hate on drake, when I ask them why
9/8/19, 10:52 - Marco: Their answer is at some point always on the line of "too mainstream, everyone listens to him"
9/8/19, 10:52 - Marco: Fucking so??
9/8/19, 10:53 - Marco: And then they listen to asap rocky
9/8/19, 10:53 - Marco: Coherence in a nutshell, the proof that they listen to music only based on trend and not on actual taste
9/8/19, 10:59 - Marco: Damn
9/8/19, 10:59 - Marco: 'Almost'
9/8/19, 10:59 - Marco: Yeah but even if they didbt
9/8/19, 10:59 - Marco: That's such a stupid point
9/8/19, 10:59 - Marco: Only because something is famous doesnt mean it's bad
9/8/19, 11:00 - Marco: Yeah probably but there is a hierarchy for sure
9/8/19, 11:00 - Marco: Hahaha didnt mean that
9/8/19, 11:00 - Marco: Ok I gotta get to amsterdam so I better get up from this bed
9/8/19, 11:42 - Marco: Gonna pick up the bike

9/8/19, 21:01 - Marco: But I understand what you mean
9/8/19, 21:01 - Marco: But I think you would have got it better if you shot it from lower
9/8/19, 21:02 - Marco: Yeah the perspective is nice
9/8/19, 22:44 - Marco: Now im watching the anime

9/9/19, 23:07 - Marco: r/wimmelbilder
9/9/19, 23:09 - Marco: No the style of this illustration is all but cyberpunk
9/9/19, 23:09 - Marco: Yeah I know that the films are cyberpunk
9/9/19, 23:09 - Marco: But I was talking about the illustration haha

9/9/19, 23:19 - Marco: Thanks
9/11/19, 12:06 - Marco: d you do the tap story
9/11/19, 12:07 - Marco: you already have idea
9/11/19, 12:07 - Marco: for borders
9/11/19, 12:07 - Marco: we can choose what kind of borders to talk about right
9/11/19, 12:08 - Marco: Uhm no not really
9/11/19, 12:08 - Marco: I need to find an idea
9/11/19, 12:08 - Marco: What kind of borders are you talking about if i can ask
9/11/19, 12:08 - Marco: Okk
9/11/19, 12:08 - Marco: In a social perspective?
9/11/19, 12:09 - Marco: That's interesting
9/11/19, 12:09 - Marco: I can imagine how you could represent it visually
9/11/19, 12:11 - Marco: Yes
9/11/19, 12:11 - Marco: Alright
9/11/19, 12:11 - Marco: That's cool
9/11/19, 12:12 - Marco: Hahahaha yes
9/11/19, 12:12 - Marco: I was thinking about cultural borders or smth
9/11/19, 12:12 - Marco: Cause I dont really wanna talk about myself for a while with what I do at school
9/11/19, 12:12 - Marco: I did it way too much last year to a point where it was cringy
9/11/19, 12:18 - Marco: Well italians happen to be/act as one of the most ignorant people in the world
9/11/19, 12:18 - Marco: And that's the major cause for the constant instability of our country
9/11/19, 12:19 - Marco: But that's too political
9/11/19, 12:19 - Marco: So I also was thinking about the migrants situation
9/11/19, 12:19 - Marco: But idk i will research a bit
9/11/19, 12:19 - Marco: It's true
9/11/19, 12:24 - Marco: Do you remember if she showed examples
9/11/19, 12:25 - Marco: I'll rephrase
9/11/19, 12:25 - Marco: Do you remember any example she made?
9/11/19, 12:27 - Marco: Oh yeah and the one in mexico
9/11/19, 12:28 - Marco: Wtf i dont remember this
9/11/19, 12:44 - Marco: I don't remember at all
9/11/19, 12:46 - Marco: 110%
9/11/19, 12:46 - Marco: In general
9/11/19, 12:47 - Marco: Hahahah why
9/11/19, 12:50 - Marco: Oh
9/11/19, 12:50 - Marco: Rly
9/11/19, 12:50 - Marco: Sorry
9/11/19, 12:51 - Marco: Yeah I have big trouble with focusing
9/11/19, 12:51 - Marco: In general
9/11/19, 12:54 - Marco: It definitely is a problem for me
9/11/19, 13:01 - Marco: Well it is when it starts affecting your "life performance"
9/11/19, 14:49 - Marco: Let's just say that their name is not really descriptive of their products
9/11/19, 14:59 - Marco: Meh
9/11/19, 15:00 - Marco: Technically better
9/11/19, 15:13 - Marco: Hahahahah
9/11/19, 15:13 - Marco: W I D E B O Y
9/11/19, 15:22 - Marco: Nice
9/11/19, 15:22 - Marco: I have two ideas and i dont know which one i should choose
9/11/19, 15:31 - Marco: Coool
9/11/19, 15:32 - Marco: Don't you have this thing like
9/11/19, 15:32 - Marco: I really like to talk about big, intense or usually sad matters
9/11/19, 15:32 - Marco: But I really have this fear of being looked at as the guy who just makes depressing work
9/11/19, 15:32 - Marco: Yes it is
9/11/19, 15:33 - Marco: I would rather talk about something serious like migrants than something funny in my work
9/11/19, 15:35 - Marco: I know
9/11/19, 15:35 - Marco: But I don't wanna be funny at all costs
9/11/19, 15:35 - Marco: What I wanna talk about in my tap story is quite a sad atory
9/11/19, 15:35 - Marco: Story
9/11/19, 15:35 - Marco: About migrants
9/11/19, 15:36 - Marco: Alright
9/11/19, 15:36 - Marco: True
9/11/19, 15:36 - Marco: I have time
9/11/19, 15:36 - Marco: Ok
9/11/19, 15:36 - Marco: Thank you haha
9/11/19, 15:37 - Marco: Ok Shia Labeouf
9/11/19, 15:37 - Marco: But true it's crazy that I still get stuck in this loops
9/11/19, 15:37 - Marco: Gonna make this
9/11/19, 15:39 - Marco: Oh ye
9/11/19, 15:47 - Marco: So
9/11/19, 16:16 - Marco: Yeah but remember I'm on probation
9/11/19, 16:16 - Marco: Hahaha wow
9/11/19, 16:16 - Marco: It looks fantastic
9/11/19, 16:16 - Marco: I also have to change strings to my ukulele
9/11/19, 16:16 - Marco: Never done it
9/11/19, 16:17 - Marco: Haha didnt expect you to remember
9/11/19, 17:26 - Marco: I think so
9/11/19, 17:26 - Marco: I was doing research about the migrants situation and stumbled on this article from last year
9/11/19, 17:26 - Marco: About this van in belgium full of migrants and a girl called mawda being shot by police
9/11/19, 17:27 - Marco: As they were attempting to leave for uk
9/11/19, 17:27 - Marco: I wanna tell the story only with audio
9/11/19, 17:27 - Marco: So all the slides will be black
9/11/19, 17:27 - Marco: Cause that's what you see if you're closed inside a van
9/11/19, 17:28 - Marco: You only hear
9/11/19, 17:28 - Marco: I think it's a nice experiment on a very serious topic
9/11/19, 17:29 - Marco: What do you think
9/11/19, 17:30 - Marco: Be honest haha
9/11/19, 17:30 - Marco: I still have time to do something else
9/11/19, 17:30 - Marco: Not at all
9/11/19, 17:31 - Marco: It's actually simpler cause i don't have to use images or visual input
9/11/19, 17:31 - Marco: And it's very short, I sure can make it in time, that's not the point
9/11/19, 17:31 - Marco: But what you think of the idea
9/11/19, 17:32 - Marco: Uhm yeah but audio is a way of visualizing
9/11/19, 17:33 - Marco: Quote by johan
9/11/19, 17:34 - Marco: How is it coming along
9/11/19, 17:44 - Marco: <Media omitted>
9/11/19, 17:45 - Marco: Hahahah jk
9/11/19, 17:45 - Marco: Sounds good and true
9/11/19, 17:46 - Marco: It's nice, really gives a mood
9/11/19, 18:34 - Marco: Yeah it maybe a bit confusing to start with outside and then say I'm staying in
9/11/19, 18:34 - Marco: Ahahahah
9/11/19, 18:52 - Marco: Wut
9/11/19, 18:55 - Marco: Me too

9/11/19, 18:56 - Marco: Time
9/11/19, 18:56 - Marco: And I forgot how fun it was for me
9/11/19, 18:56 - Marco: Certainly not
9/11/19, 18:56 - Marco: For me this makes me drepressed so no ahah
9/11/19, 18:59 - Marco: So the more humid the more energetic you are?
9/11/19, 19:01 - Marco: Adhd gives high blood pressure?

9/11/19, 19:36 - Marco: I like the one with the stairs
9/11/19, 19:37 - Marco: Don't remember what it does
9/11/19, 20:02 - Marco: I'll see it when I finish mine
9/11/19, 20:03 - Marco: I thing I got quite a thrilling little storytelling
9/11/19, 20:03 - Marco: I hope it's understandable though
9/11/19, 20:06 - Marco: Ahahahah to what point are we gonna bring this
9/11/19, 20:07 - Marco: We're gonna play it on the church bells at some point
9/11/19, 20:07 - Marco: In space
9/11/19, 20:07 - Marco: With a 960-black middle-aged people gospel choir

9/11/19, 20:26 - Marco: Jesus ahahahah I wish you could attach it to the ukulele
9/11/19, 20:27 - Marco: I'll give you one last song then I'll get back to work

10/8/19, 14:35 - Marco: And no one is gonna accept it
10/8/19, 14:35 - Marco: So I suggested him a variation

10/8/19, 14:44 - Marco: But I don't care/mind enough atm honestly
10/8/19, 14:44 - Marco: It's not made with bad intentions for sure
10/8/19, 14:44 - Marco: Just not really good execution
10/8/19, 14:45 - Marco: Yeah that's the impression I had when I made him notice
10/8/19, 14:46 - Marco: I read this in a scottish accent
10/8/19, 14:46 - Marco: I told you and I told him
10/8/19, 14:46 - Marco: I don't agree and I wont be the only one for sure

10/14/19, 21:27 - Marco: When am I invited to your house
10/14/19, 22:14 - Marco: Ahahahahah
10/14/19, 22:14 - Marco: That you have that vinyl
10/14/19, 22:16 - Marco: Double trouble
10/14/19, 23:28 - Marco: Ofc
10/14/19, 23:28 - Marco: <Media omitted>
10/15/19, 01:10 - Marco: Hahah stupid bitch
10/15/19, 01:11 - Marco: But thank you very much, you can't imagine how it helped
10/15/19, 01:11 - Marco: How much
10/15/19, 01:16 - Marco: That's true I'm giving her way too much relevance by just putting any effort in ignoring her, I should really stop and just be respectful and stop to that, I'll try me best
10/15/19, 08:32 - Marco: Great
10/15/19, 08:33 - Marco: I went to sleep at 4.15
10/15/19, 08:42 - Marco: Yes I did sir
10/15/19, 08:42 - Marco: I stayed to make things for today
10/15/19, 08:42 - Marco: Actually very willingly
10/15/19, 08:43 - Marco: I wasnt even tired (which I am now)
10/15/19, 08:43 - Marco: Yeah I'll work on a clay model today
10/15/19, 09:07 - Marco: Today we have to dress up
10/15/19, 09:20 - Marco: Idk
10/15/19, 09:20 - Marco: Wooow
10/15/19, 09:34 - Marco: Cause that's the intention
10/15/19, 09:34 - Marco: And I doubt that jeroen forgot
10/15/19, 10:11 - Marco: Ahahahaha
10/15/19, 16:01 - Marco: Wat u think o' my proposal
10/15/19, 16:08 - Marco: occ
10/15/19, 16:16 - Marco: Yeah
10/15/19, 16:16 - Marco: We already tried this method last year and it never worked
10/15/19, 16:17 - Marco: Because people are too afraid to "compromise' themselves
10/15/19, 16:17 - Marco: Or because they don't necessarily want to be seen as the ones who think that specific bad thing
10/15/19, 16:18 - Marco: I think that's reasonable
10/15/19, 16:18 - Marco: But then we have to use a method that allows to spit the real t you know what I'm sayin
10/15/19, 16:19 - Marco: And if there are still problems unsloved after all these structured efforts to solve stuff it means that not all the truth is coming oit
10/15/19, 16:19 - Marco: Out
10/15/19, 16:20 - Marco: Hahaha
10/15/19, 16:20 - Marco: Yeah
10/15/19, 16:20 - Marco: All this apologetic attitude
10/15/19, 16:20 - Marco: This forced political correctness
10/15/19, 16:20 - Marco: Will never make anyone be honest
10/15/19, 16:20 - Marco: Everyone will say the truth that may hurt the least people possible
10/15/19, 16:20 - Marco: But in order to change and get better you have to accept the possibility of being hurt
10/15/19, 16:21 - Marco: and of being compromised
10/15/19, 16:21 - Marco: And most importantly
10/15/19, 16:21 - Marco: They have to accept the possibility that not everyone may see every problem
10/15/19, 16:21 - Marco: Like that thing that you said yesterdat
10/15/19, 16:22 - Marco: About the fact that many people still act like high school
10/15/19, 16:22 - Marco: That there are the "cool peeps" and the others
10/15/19, 16:22 - Marco: 100% true
10/15/19, 16:22 - Marco: And if you're not gonna say it I'm gonna
10/15/19, 16:22 - Marco: I think it's one of the main problems of this class
10/15/19, 16:23 - Marco: Hahah
10/15/19, 16:23 - Marco: thanks
10/15/19, 16:23 - Marco: end of the convpo
10/15/19, 16:23 - Marco: bb
10/15/19, 16:24 - Marco: But do you think it's a good proposal?
10/15/19, 16:24 - Marco: The one I made on the group
10/15/19, 16:24 - Marco: I mean do you agree
10/15/19, 16:25 - Marco: I'VE
10/15/19, 16:25 - Marco: BECOME SO
10/15/19, 16:25 - Marco: ok no
10/15/19, 16:25 - Marco: go on
10/15/19, 16:26 - Marco: i don't know what the latter is
10/15/19, 16:27 - Marco: the second of the two things you said
10/15/19, 16:27 - Marco: Cool
10/15/19, 16:29 - Marco: ahahahaha
10/15/19, 16:29 - Marco: the amount of hate on that song
10/15/19, 16:29 - Marco: and btw
10/15/19, 16:30 - Marco: jeroen seeing the message and not answering
10/15/19, 16:30 - Marco: great start for a very respectful and healthy discussion :)
10/15/19, 16:30 - Marco: ReCheck yosself
10/15/19, 16:30 - Marco: before I ReWreck yosself
10/15/19, 16:31 - Marco: Jesus fucking h motherfucking christ
10/15/19, 16:31 - Marco: yeah but he's making kindness a reason to be boastful
10/15/19, 16:31 - Marco: and a borderline douchebag
10/15/19, 16:32 - Marco: I think it's fine to be taking the lead
10/15/19, 16:32 - Marco: But not for the sake of it
10/15/19, 16:32 - Marco: I said borderline
10/15/19, 16:32 - Marco: When you push some kind of behaviour too much you're always a douchebag
10/15/19, 16:32 - Marco: I mean sure
10/15/19, 16:32 - Marco: ""
10/15/19, 16:33 - Marco: I can hear his voice
10/15/19, 16:33 - Marco: I'm fine with him
10/15/19, 16:33 - Marco: It's just that when I criticize someone's trait I go all out
10/15/19, 16:33 - Marco: Every time
10/15/19, 16:33 - Marco: Doesn't mean I hate him or anything
10/15/19, 16:33 - Marco: He has good and bad sides like everyone
10/15/19, 16:34 - Marco: And I'm all about calling out those spicy bad sides
10/15/19, 16:34 - Marco: Ahahahah
10/15/19, 16:35 - Marco: WoWoWow
10/15/19, 16:35 - Marco: I was hooked to that song until 1 week ago
10/15/19, 16:35 - Marco: Thank you for having reminded me again
10/15/19, 16:36 - Marco: Yes
10/15/19, 16:36 - Marco: They should use that song
10/15/19, 16:36 - Marco: Hahahahah wow
10/15/19, 16:36 - Marco: They have all my respect
10/15/19, 16:38 - Marco: what you mean loose
10/15/19, 16:38 - Marco: ooh
10/15/19, 16:38 - Marco: yeah idk
10/15/19, 16:38 - Marco: i think he's fine
10/15/19, 16:38 - Marco: just needs to stop with this attitude
10/15/19, 16:38 - Marco: because he also has a bit of this cool kid attitude
10/15/19, 16:39 - Marco: but not too much
10/15/19, 16:39 - Marco: but in these cases it's annoying that he showcases his ideas as if he knows that they will work for sure at the end
10/15/19, 16:40 - Marco: Hahahah
10/15/19, 16:40 - Marco: wtf
10/15/19, 16:40 - Marco: why would he say that
10/15/19, 16:42 - Marco: chad
10/15/19, 16:43 - Marco: ahahahhahahahahahahahahahah
10/15/19, 16:43 - Marco: omg
10/15/19, 16:43 - Marco: never thought about it
10/15/19, 16:43 - Marco: ahahahahha
10/15/19, 16:43 - Marco: ahahahahahahah
10/15/19, 16:43 - Marco: i'm in tears
10/15/19, 16:43 - Marco: amazing comparison, made my day
10/15/19, 16:43 - Marco: hahahah
10/15/19, 16:43 - Marco: but how do you cope with people like this
10/15/19, 16:43 - Marco: i mean
10/15/19, 16:44 - Marco: it's also a coping method, his
10/15/19, 16:45 - Marco: yeah but it's not healthy
10/15/19, 16:45 - Marco: forced positivity
10/15/19, 16:45 - Marco: never
10/15/19, 16:46 - Marco: yeah
10/15/19, 16:46 - Marco: true
10/15/19, 16:48 - Marco: but all of this makes me think then that he's a fraud
10/15/19, 16:48 - Marco: showcasing all this positivity just to hide from others and himself something unsolved
10/15/19, 16:48 - Marco: but also it's none of my business
10/15/19, 16:49 - Marco: being adults is way more difficult than it looks like when you're a kid
10/15/19, 16:49 - Marco: a thing that i've realized lately
10/15/19, 16:50 - Marco: and it came to me like a fucking metheorite over my head
10/15/19, 16:50 - Marco: no ahah
10/15/19, 16:50 - Marco: But I'm really realizing it many more people that I would have ever thought
10/15/19, 16:51 - Marco: How many have their behaviours just as a defense mechanism from something they don't have the bravery to cope with
10/15/19, 16:51 - Marco: I think I know 3 or 4 people that don't have this
10/15/19, 16:51 - Marco: or maybe they have it but at least they are aware
10/15/19, 16:51 - Marco: and show intention in changing
10/15/19, 16:52 - Marco: I mean what I think is that being adult is being aware of both the qualities and the faults, and the bravery and will to fix those faults
10/15/19, 16:52 - Marco: wym
10/15/19, 16:53 - Marco: I always say that I changed a lot during last year and I've been more depressed than I ever thought possible, and most of it just came from various episodes of realization of the fact that I have big things that need to be changed
10/15/19, 16:53 - Marco: But some people really cover their eyes in front of this kinda truth
10/15/19, 16:54 - Marco: Sometimes for their whole life, until they forget it
10/15/19, 17:46 - Marco: No I agree with you
10/15/19, 17:47 - Marco: I didn't mean to put myself in a presumptuous position, but you're right
10/15/19, 17:47 - Marco: I assume too much maybe
10/15/19, 17:59 - Marco: ahahahha
10/15/19, 18:05 - Marco: Yeah no I'm not going today
10/15/19, 18:05 - Marco: From next week on

10/20/19, 11:15 - Marco: The feeling of having a laundry machine and drier next to your door for free instead of 10 mins biking for 6 euros per washing machine is incomparable
10/20/19, 11:17 - Marco: Be happy with what you have and think about what people like me had to do for 1 year

10/20/19, 22:37 - Marco: <Media omitted>
10/20/19, 22:41 - Marco: Ja
10/20/19, 22:44 - Marco: Love the vibe that these chords have
10/20/19, 22:44 - Marco: And you play them really well
10/20/19, 22:44 - Marco: It's like they have something trascendental
10/20/19, 22:44 - Marco: Or like connected to my subconscious
10/20/19, 22:44 - Marco: I don't know how to explain it
10/20/19, 22:44 - Marco: But they have a visual/sensorial power on me that is almost hypnotizing

10/28/19, 15:32 - Marco: Sorry if that was not your intention haha
10/28/19, 15:32 - Marco: The last couple sentences saved it
10/28/19, 15:33 - Marco: But it was so incredibly accurate
10/28/19, 15:33 - Marco: If it was, mad respect for putting out your opinions about it so fiercely

10/28/19, 17:11 - Marco: I'm not stressed, but even though I put all the effort in bettering myself and my way to cope with things I still now and then get this stupid mood swings
10/28/19, 17:12 - Marco: Getting completely gloomy and hopeless out of nowhere
10/28/19, 17:12 - Marco: That's stressing
10/28/19, 17:12 - Marco: Soo yeah but now it's better

10/28/19, 17:13 - Marco: Like a rusty clockwork
10/28/19, 17:13 - Marco: I'm not but teachers don't really care about this stuff, they care about seeing work done and if I keep getting this it will never happen
10/28/19, 17:14 - Marco: Hopefully it will pass
10/28/19, 17:30 - Marco: <Media omitted>

11/5/19, 20:31 - Marco: Not because of that
11/5/19, 20:31 - Marco: My best friend made me notice a recurring pattern in my recent behaviour that I didn't notice was happening
11/5/19, 20:31 - Marco: But the way she did it was horrible
11/5/19, 20:32 - Marco: Like the worst way possible, and it kinda brought my mood down

11/5/19, 20:33 - Marco: First world problem let's say
11/5/19, 20:33 - Marco: Like very abstract
11/5/19, 20:34 - Marco: But imagine someone telling you "hey by the way it's been some months that you're gerting worse and worse at this behaviour and this makes me sad and irritated" while you didnt even have a clue
11/5/19, 20:34 - Marco: All this while you're actively and constantly trying to better yourself
11/5/19, 20:34 - Marco: ?

11/5/19, 20:35 - Marco: H Y P E R F O C U S
11/5/19, 20:40 - Marco: Yeah it's always difficult to not compare yourself in an unealthy way to others

11/18/19, 00:04 - Marco: Like your mind is in a completely different and faraway place from where your body is
11/18/19, 00:06 - Marco: Hope you better now
11/18/19, 09:36 - Marco: That's something

11/18/19, 21:12 - Marco: It's like
11/18/19, 21:13 - Marco: I always had a lot of trouble in throwing stuff away because I feel like one day I might need it or like it again
11/18/19, 21:13 - Marco: But also if I wanna have a definite style I need the bravery to be selective
11/18/19, 21:13 - Marco: Not throwing them away
11/18/19, 21:13 - Marco: I'm gonna sell them in school and the rest on marktplaats or donated

11/18/19, 21:14 - Marco: Like graffiti
11/18/19, 21:15 - Marco: Wildstyle is a very extreme iteration of the letter

11/19/19, 23:05 - Marco: Yeah I know but she's proving it more and more
11/19/19, 23:05 - Marco: And I feel like also other people in the class are realizing
11/19/19, 23:06 - Marco: No one is really enjoying her company anymore and that is also why she's keeping roberto so firghteningly close to her
11/19/19, 23:06 - Marco: (Is that a word)
11/19/19, 23:06 - Marco: But yeah I've got to know her enough to know what's going on
11/19/19, 23:06 - Marco: And I'm not happy about it, I'm very sorry about it honestly
11/19/19, 23:07 - Marco: I sincerely wish she could realize it but I cannot just go there and tell her, I'm not better than her or anything
11/19/19, 23:07 - Marco: Hope she understands by herseld one day

12/11/19, 18:23 - Marco: So if they say what I tell them to Gert he's gonna say this
12/11/19, 18:24 - Marco: So they will see that this has nothing to do with the fact that I missed it right
12/11/19, 18:25 - Marco: I get it
12/11/19, 18:25 - Marco: That's fine

12/12/19, 09:15 - Marco: Not coming to school today
12/12/19, 09:16 - Marco: Have to rest + have a lot of stuff to get figured out before I leave + doctor at.13 + work at 17 and it's gonna rain with -4 degrees and that's about as much as I can handle for today
12/12/19, 09:17 - Marco: Sarah's class would just be a waste of time, also cause I have nothing to present
12/12/19, 09:18 - Marco: Hahaha is it enough
12/12/19, 09:18 - Marco: Plus my energy is weird today
12/12/19, 09:19 - Marco: So I'd rather stay home and work on that also
12/12/19, 09:19 - Marco: I'm the opposite, I was like that yesterday so I understand what you mean

12/12/19, 17:58 - Marco: Hahahah

12/12/19, 19:34 - Marco: Did you actually like it when you saw it btw
12/12/19, 19:34 - Marco: Cause I feel like many people are just saying it cause i put a lot of effort
12/12/19, 19:34 - Marco: But it's not great by itself
12/12/19, 19:34 - Marco: Yes!

12/16/19, 20:22 - Marco: I'm not really in love with the hummingbird idea
12/16/19, 20:22 - Marco: tbh
12/16/19, 20:22 - Marco: it's just something that i find kinda interesting and I don't have time to think of something completely new
12/16/19, 20:22 - Marco: Also not the energy
12/16/19, 20:23 - Marco: So I'll do my best with what I have
12/16/19, 20:23 - Marco: And next semester try to do better (if I pass)

12/16/19, 20:25 - Marco: 24 hours
12/16/19, 20:26 - Marco: ?
12/16/19, 20:27 - Marco: hahahah
12/16/19, 20:27 - Marco: depends on the location I book

12/18/19, 22:05 - Marco: Good but this morning totally opposite, thx for asking
12/18/19, 22:05 - Marco: Now I'm intensive cardiotherapy dept

12/18/19, 22:06 - Marco: Hahahahah
12/19/19, 08:11 - Marco: Could you please tell Sara to check her e-mail when she gets there?
12/19/19, 08:19 - Marco: Thx
12/19/19, 08:56 - Marco: I don't mean to sound intensitive or smth
12/19/19, 08:56 - Marco: And I'm happy you progressed
12/19/19, 08:56 - Marco: But rn I couldn't care less haha
12/19/19, 08:56 - Marco: Yeah I mean the situation calls for it
12/19/19, 10:58 - Marco: Did you see her/tell her?
12/19/19, 10:59 - Marco: K
12/19/19, 10:59 - Marco: Oh ok
12/19/19, 13:40 - Marco: <Media omitted>
12/19/19, 13:40 - Marco: What does she mean with * your *
12/19/19, 15:53 - Marco: Looks great
12/19/19, 15:53 - Marco: But I'd say this convo is getting a bit one-sided isn't it
12/19/19, 15:54 - Marco: If you're busy/stressed with school I understand, I'm just not the best person you can address this with rn you know
12/19/19, 15:55 - Marco: Unless it's a bit balanced, otherwise I don't really feel at ease tb
12/19/19, 16:00 - Marco: I sent her a long ass email with all the updates on what I wanna do for all the assignments and I asked her some feedback and guidance on the one for the next semester cause i'm not sure yet
12/19/19, 16:00 - Marco: And all she writes is this
12/19/19, 16:01 - Marco: And I don't understand the asterisks either but maybe i'm being to picky but still wtf
12/19/19, 16:01 - Marco: You shall be forgiven though
12/19/19, 16:58 - Marco: Oh yeah now I get why maybe, but still she could have been way more "eloquent"
12/19/19, 16:58 - Marco: Also because I explicitly asked her for feedback and advicd
12/19/19, 16:58 - Marco: Advice
12/19/19, 17:07 - Marco: I get it
12/19/19, 17:07 - Marco: But I kinda expected it from her
12/19/19, 17:10 - Marco: Yeah I knkw
12/19/19, 17:10 - Marco: Know
12/23/19, 09:53 - Marco: Ahahahaha❤❤

12/23/19, 15:26 - Marco: Ofc
12/23/19, 15:26 - Marco: I would do the same

12/23/19, 15:31 - Marco: Which season is it
12/23/19, 15:31 - Marco: I rewatched a couple episodes after having watched the office and I had half as fun as before
12/23/19, 15:31 - Marco: S17 is not too nice i feel like
12/23/19, 15:32 - Marco: Less than half
12/23/19, 15:34 - Marco: No but also the humour
12/23/19, 15:34 - Marco: I don't mind the topics that much
12/23/19, 15:34 - Marco: It's really the humour that I found stale and low effort a bit
12/23/19, 15:37 - Marco: Yeah I guess you're right
12/23/19, 15:37 - Marco: I also watched it way too much
12/23/19, 15:38 - Marco: Oh yeah I remember that episode, the one where the house becomes a whole white space or something right hahah
12/23/19, 15:38 - Marco: Yeah that's quite cool
12/23/19, 15:40 - Marco: Hahahahaha
12/23/19, 15:40 - Marco: Why did he guess

12/27/19, 14:37 - Marco: Yeah true but I don't like the beat that much
12/27/19, 14:38 - Marco: But KRS's flow is really outstanding

12/28/19, 10:27 - Marco: Understandable
12/28/19, 10:27 - Marco: THE FEAST
12/28/19, 12:04 - Marco: You're telling that to me
12/28/19, 12:04 - Marco: I don't remember this episode and I'm not sure who he is
12/28/19, 12:06 - Marco: Oooh ja
12/28/19, 12:25 - Marco: Yeah there was a post on reddit last week that showed that thing being still there in Scranton
12/28/19, 12:25 - Marco: Even though the paper company there has another name now, they left that
12/28/19, 12:26 - Marco: Maybe as a tribute to the show
12/28/19, 14:40 - Marco: Ahahahaha

1/4/20, 12:11 - Marco: My thing will look so underwhelming
1/4/20, 12:11 - Marco: It's not gonna be interactive probably
1/4/20, 12:11 - Marco: Just an animated 3d thing on a screen
1/4/20, 12:15 - Marco: Hahaha well it's still gonna be underwhelming nevertheless
1/4/20, 22:13 - Marco: Ahahahah

1/5/20, 16:53 - Marco: Don't send me this stuff haha
1/5/20, 16:55 - Marco: Makes me remember that mine is not a sturdy, solid piece of furniture i made in the kabk workshops
1/5/20, 16:55 - Marco: Which probably means I'm gonna fail the course
1/5/20, 16:56 - Marco: Oh yeah

1/5/20, 17:41 - Marco: Yeah I mean
1/5/20, 17:41 - Marco: My main concern is that I should have started my laughing furniture before but I left it for christmas because I managed my time very badly
1/5/20, 17:41 - Marco: But at the same time, it's because every tuesday I got myself very busy with the IST
1/5/20, 17:42 - Marco: I'm just a but worried of which one of this two things (my bad time management or the fact that I still worked on school and not just wasted time) they are gonna care about more
1/5/20, 17:43 - Marco: Cause they would be right if they said it was my responsibility to have something built before christmas
1/5/20, 17:43 - Marco: It was my fault for not having it done before, so idk if they are gonna take my health condition as an excuse or smth
1/5/20, 17:43 - Marco: Are you sick btw?
1/5/20, 17:44 - Marco: And can I send you the thing I've done? the furniture. Still gonna have to add something but I have the 3d rendering

2/16/20, 23:07 - Marco: oligopoly*
2/16/20, 23:07 - Marco: oligarchy is for government (but with lobbying that's not too different)
2/16/20, 23:07 - Marco: AKSCHUAKLLLY
2/16/20, 23:09 - Marco: The unbearable burden of omniscience
2/16/20, 23:09 - Marco: Hahahaha
2/16/20, 23:10 - Marco: The company I researched is also involved in that
2/16/20, 23:10 - Marco: As every multinational I think
2/16/20, 23:10 - Marco: I would dump my sketches on the group but
2/16/20, 23:10 - Marco: They would be incomprehensible so let's see tuesday directly

3/1/20, 13:21 - Marco: What about after school
3/1/20, 13:22 - Marco: Jaman
3/1/20, 13:26 - Marco: Great to hear
3/1/20, 13:27 - Marco: You can probably even get dr martens for 25 euros
3/1/20, 13:28 - Marco: Haha aight
3/1/20, 13:28 - Marco: Ok gotta call my mom sorry
3/1/20, 13:28 - Marco: Never hear something like vegan leather haha

3/1/20, 13:29 - Marco: But now gotta leave for more 10 days to call my motha
3/1/20, 17:06 - Marco: Oh I'm happy for you
3/1/20, 17:06 - Marco: That you get tit
3/1/20, 17:06 - Marco: Not everyone does
3/1/20, 17:06 - Marco: But you're lucky
3/1/20, 17:06 - Marco: A tit getter
3/1/20, 17:06 - Marco: yeah i get tit
3/1/20, 17:10 - Marco: i feel u
3/1/20, 17:25 - Marco: Nice
3/1/20, 17:25 - Marco: My course was very intense and I'm gonna tell you
3/1/20, 17:25 - Marco: I feel like it really changed my way of thinking (for the better) even though I have to practice quite a lot
3/1/20, 17:26 - Marco: Not gonna become jeroen 2 though
3/1/20, 17:26 - Marco: don't worry
3/1/20, 17:27 - Marco: bUt YoU jUsT hAvE tO bE pOsItIvE
3/1/20, 17:27 - Marco: no ofc
3/1/20, 17:28 - Marco: The funny thing is that this sentence is completely in opposition with the message of the meditation technique
3/1/20, 17:29 - Marco: but yeah jeroen is not too bad
3/1/20, 17:29 - Marco: In general i feel like I can appreciate everyone way more
3/1/20, 17:30 - Marco: Even wies
3/1/20, 17:30 - Marco: I really changed my attitude on her
3/1/20, 17:30 - Marco: How do you know hah
3/1/20, 17:31 - Marco: It happened during the thing
3/1/20, 17:33 - Marco: Yeah but also apart from what the meditation did for me in that regard
3/1/20, 17:33 - Marco: I also had a major realization on her
3/1/20, 17:33 - Marco: Quite sad realization but that's my view
3/1/20, 17:33 - Marco: Maybe it's not even the truth but it makes sense to me
3/1/20, 17:33 - Marco: And it is that
3/1/20, 17:34 - Marco: Actually idk if you care hhaa
3/1/20, 17:34 - Marco: I think I'm the only one who could care about something like this
3/1/20, 17:35 - Marco: well the conclusion of it is that she is suffering a lot for the loss of her brother and she is seeking other people to have the same attitude with (and she talked to me often about how she behaved with her brother)
3/1/20, 17:36 - Marco: She told me that she was very very bonded to him
3/1/20, 17:36 - Marco: but at his funeral she didnt even cry
3/1/20, 17:36 - Marco: so she definitely kept that suffering inside and she is not letting it out
3/1/20, 17:36 - Marco: and as she explained it it was the same exact attitude she had with me and she is having with roberto
3/1/20, 17:37 - Marco: And I'm grateful I came to terms with this after the meditation because if I had thought of this earlier it would have crushed me
3/1/20, 17:37 - Marco: Of course
3/1/20, 17:38 - Marco: That's also why I don't feel any hate towards her now
3/1/20, 17:38 - Marco: Hahah *rolls down list*
3/1/20, 17:44 - Marco: That's one thing I learned very much and well in this 10 days :)
3/1/20, 17:44 - Marco: very proud
3/1/20, 17:45 - Marco: Woke up at 4.00 am with a smile on my face
3/1/20, 17:45 - Marco: Couldn't believe myself
3/1/20, 17:45 - Marco: Went to bed with no dinner, no craving for it at all
3/1/20, 17:45 - Marco: And the amount of food I hate before at dinner was i n s a n e
3/1/20, 17:45 - Marco: Not human trust me
3/1/20, 17:45 - Marco: This technique is really da shit man
3/1/20, 17:46 - Marco: I prefer to explain in person
3/1/20, 17:46 - Marco: It is quite long
3/1/20, 17:46 - Marco: I can explain you at lunch tomorro
3/1/20, 17:46 - Marco: It's not dogmatic at all because you experience everything first hand
3/1/20, 17:47 - Marco: And I don't know how much you know about Vipassana
3/1/20, 17:47 - Marco: But it is possibly the least dogmatic serious meditation technique
3/1/20, 17:47 - Marco: The premise is that literally everyone can practice it
3/1/20, 17:47 - Marco: It is not religious
3/1/20, 17:48 - Marco: It doesn't ask you to accept anything that you don't actually experience yourself
3/1/20, 17:48 - Marco: And everything is scientific and rational and makes perfect sense
3/1/20, 17:48 - Marco: Because it is so simple and straightforward
3/1/20, 17:48 - Marco: It's really crazy, I'm gonna tell you tomorrow if you want
3/1/20, 17:48 - Marco: Now gotta catch up with 10 days of work
3/1/20, 17:49 - Marco: Yeah
3/1/20, 17:49 - Marco: I didn't even know it before joining it
3/1/20, 17:49 - Marco: I didn't almost know anything about it
3/1/20, 17:49 - Marco: Yeah the principles are possibly the least important thing
3/1/20, 17:50 - Marco: hahahah
3/1/20, 17:50 - Marco: The "typing..." thing is very flashy
3/1/20, 17:51 - Marco: ye
3/1/20, 17:54 - Marco: yeah i know they do
3/1/20, 17:54 - Marco: i will
3/1/20, 17:54 - Marco: Haha wow
3/1/20, 17:54 - Marco: like, a conference?
3/1/20, 17:55 - Marco: He is a very controversial person afaik
3/1/20, 17:56 - Marco: Yeah I learned about it
3/1/20, 17:56 - Marco: but vipassana is the pure storic buddhism
3/1/20, 17:56 - Marco: Straight from the buddha
3/1/20, 17:56 - Marco: g o double t
3/1/20, 17:57 - Marco: ja man
3/1/20, 17:57 - Marco: but yeah in the course they said something about these "polluted" dirty versions of buddhism
3/1/20, 17:57 - Marco: so I'm very grateful I came to know this one
3/1/20, 17:57 - Marco: the message is wholesome and I really did feel it
3/1/20, 17:58 - Marco: in direct experience
3/1/20, 17:58 - Marco: it is just really cheesy to say but
3/1/20, 17:58 - Marco: I felt really really full of love at the end of the course
3/1/20, 17:58 - Marco: That is just how it was
3/1/20, 17:58 - Marco: I was literally radiating
3/1/20, 17:58 - Marco: But I can also imagine that this is not what everyone is looking for
3/1/20, 17:58 - Marco: yeah I'll love you anyway
3/1/20, 17:59 - Marco: ;)
3/1/20, 18:06 - Marco: with pure I only mean that it comes straight from him as far as it is historically researched
3/1/20, 18:06 - Marco: That's all I mean
3/1/20, 18:06 - Marco: And the course himself has a couple dark sides for sure
3/1/20, 18:07 - Marco: But the technique itself, as far as I experienced it
3/1/20, 18:07 - Marco: And as far as many experience it
3/1/20, 18:07 - Marco: Is just direct tangible positive experience
3/1/20, 18:07 - Marco: But you have to work hard for it (just like real life)
3/1/20, 18:07 - Marco: And it purely depends on you
3/1/20, 18:08 - Marco: And having struggled with depression a lot I like that I finally can see someone in myself I can rely on
3/1/20, 18:08 - Marco: Exactly
3/1/20, 18:08 - Marco: But it depends entirely only on how disciplined and equanimous you are about the experience
3/1/20, 18:09 - Marco: And even though
3/1/20, 18:09 - Marco: In 10 days it changed my attitude and self-discipline 180 degrees
3/1/20, 18:09 - Marco: So for a while I'm gonna keep practicing it and maybe one day I'll realize I don't need it anymore
3/1/20, 18:09 - Marco: I am not looking for enlightment or complete purity (which is the true goal of Vipassana)
3/1/20, 18:10 - Marco: But just for enough happiness to live haha
3/1/20, 18:10 - Marco: so ja
3/1/20, 18:10 - Marco: one more thing before i let you go
3/1/20, 18:10 - Marco: i can't remember what we were to do for tuesday's thing
3/1/20, 18:12 - Marco: hahahahaha
3/1/20, 18:12 - Marco: i just forgot
3/1/20, 18:12 - Marco: oh ok
3/1/20, 18:12 - Marco: how
3/1/20, 18:14 - Marco: oh yeah but we have to do it individually or as a group
3/1/20, 18:18 - Marco: look at him taking all the merit
3/1/20, 18:18 - Marco: hahahah
3/1/20, 18:18 - Marco: if i didnt pose the question in the first place
3/1/20, 18:18 - Marco: the poem would not have flowed like a river out of the creek of your inspiration
3/1/20, 18:18 - Marco: ooh yeha
3/1/20, 18:18 - Marco: but I thought it first
3/1/20, 18:18 - Marco: yesterday
3/1/20, 18:19 - Marco: hahahahahah
3/1/20, 18:21 - Marco: got it
3/1/20, 18:21 - Marco: I also take a lot of control in group situations and I'm bad at avoiding it
3/1/20, 18:21 - Marco: So I'm sorry if it made you feel bad
3/1/20, 18:22 - Marco: Yeah but I just do it naturally I don't know why
3/1/20, 18:23 - Marco: Not that i don't like it, but if you felt like I put you down or something don't think it's personal or smth
3/1/20, 18:23 - Marco: I will mind it more next time, I know it irritates many people
3/1/20, 18:24 - Marco: understandable
3/1/20, 18:24 - Marco: hahah dont write more
3/1/20, 18:24 - Marco: please
3/1/20, 18:24 - Marco: we're writing everything
3/1/20, 18:25 - Marco: actually it is the both of us taking control in the group a lot
3/1/20, 18:25 - Marco: hilde a bit
3/1/20, 18:25 - Marco: i honestly don't understand this asiatic submissive tendency
3/1/20, 18:25 - Marco: not wanna be racist or smth
3/1/20, 18:25 - Marco: but i noticed it in almost everyone from asia i've met in our school
3/1/20, 18:25 - Marco: they are never really taking the lead
3/1/20, 18:26 - Marco: or maybe our western habit makes us do it too much
3/1/20, 18:26 - Marco: no girls
3/1/20, 18:26 - Marco: guys are not like that
3/1/20, 18:26 - Marco: for some reason
3/1/20, 18:26 - Marco: so not only racist also mysognistic
3/1/20, 18:26 - Marco: yeah i don't wanna offend everyone
3/1/20, 18:26 - Marco: hahahahah
3/1/20, 18:27 - Marco: i'll keep doing it
3/1/20, 18:27 - Marco: well meditation is not the solution it's a *tool*
3/1/20, 18:27 - Marco: i can use it or throw it on your head
3/1/20, 18:28 - Marco: i would like to be thrown on someone's head then
3/1/20, 18:28 - Marco: i knew you would have a comeback for that
3/1/20, 18:29 - Marco: just saved it for you and served it on a silver plate
3/1/20, 18:29 - Marco: thank me latr
3/1/20, 18:29 - Marco: ok cya

3/1/20, 19:02 - Marco: BuzzFeed hired you or smth
3/1/20, 19:02 - Marco: that doesn't go in your favor
3/1/20, 19:02 - Marco: you're boasting it like it does
3/1/20, 19:03 - Marco: hahahahahahahaahha
3/1/20, 19:03 - Marco: it took me a real while
3/1/20, 19:03 - Marco: i had to stop and close my eyes and think about it
3/1/20, 19:04 - Marco: i'll just shut up
3/1/20, 19:05 - Marco: and pretend you're not here
3/1/20, 19:05 - Marco: oh i was hoping you to say this
3/1/20, 19:07 - Lorenzo: *Here's BuzzFeed's top 10 Marco comebacks. You won't believe number 2?!*
3/1/20, 20:49 - Marco: Amazeballs
3/1/20, 20:53 - Marco: <Media omitted>
3/1/20, 20:56 - Marco: <Media omitted>
3/1/20, 20:58 - Marco: Never watched it
3/1/20, 21:01 - Marco: Thanks

3/1/20, 21:05 - Marco: Ok sorry I'll stop
3/2/20, 20:27 - Marco: yeah I'mma leave it as it is
3/2/20, 20:29 - Marco: what
3/2/20, 20:31 - Marco: I mean for every of this epidemics there is the speculation of someone profiting out of the general chaos
3/2/20, 20:31 - Marco: It is very borderline with conspiracy theories so go easy on it imo
3/2/20, 20:32 - Marco: <Media omitted>
3/2/20, 20:32 - Marco: uhm in what way
3/2/20, 20:33 - Marco: oooh

3/2/20, 21:33 - Marco: <Media omitted>
3/3/20, 01:08 - Marco: That sounds challenging damn
3/3/20, 08:11 - Marco: Sounds difficult to play
3/3/20, 08:11 - Marco: Goddamn
3/3/20, 08:47 - Marco: Music right
3/3/20, 08:47 - Marco: Hahaha
3/3/20, 10:02 - Marco: https://youtu.be/tZcuE0ZyJms
3/3/20, 10:03 - Marco: Powerful vibez
3/3/20, 20:10 - Marco: Here’s a song for you… Figli di Annibale by Almamegretta
3/3/20, 20:15 - Marco: Haha i think personally it goes beyond that
3/3/20, 20:16 - Marco: Yeah more like it
3/3/20, 20:16 - Marco: I love how they use the voice and the lyrics in a way that really is aimed to irritate the average italin
3/3/20, 20:16 - Marco: Like provoking
3/3/20, 20:17 - Marco: They are like "if you are so nationalist and you know your history so well then you also know the color of the blood that flows in your veins"
3/3/20, 20:17 - Marco: Get me some songs like it
3/3/20, 20:21 - Marco: Haha ok
3/3/20, 20:25 - Marco: Nice thanks
3/3/20, 20:56 - Marco: You didnt eat yet
3/3/20, 20:56 - Marco: Uhm ok
3/3/20, 20:57 - Marco: Oooh ja I know that feeling
3/3/20, 21:00 - Marco: HOW
3/3/20, 21:01 - Marco: No
3/3/20, 21:52 - Marco: Oh yeah

3/4/20, 21:15 - Marco: I'm sure it's greay
3/4/20, 21:15 - Marco: Great
3/4/20, 21:15 - Marco: I am very relaxed
3/4/20, 21:15 - Marco: Despite everything going the opposite as it should
3/4/20, 21:35 - Marco: Probably
3/4/20, 21:35 - Marco: But I'm starting to doubt if this is where I belong
3/4/20, 21:35 - Marco: I mean kabk
3/4/20, 21:36 - Marco: There is no reason valid enough for me to get constantly depressed everytime I have to get a new idea out of my head
3/4/20, 21:36 - Marco: For sure
3/4/20, 21:36 - Marco: But this time I'm feeling very close to "sure" of what I am saying
3/4/20, 21:37 - Marco: Yeah but not sustainable so often
3/4/20, 21:37 - Marco: A study that drives me nuts like this is not a study that is wise continuing maybe
3/4/20, 21:37 - Marco: I have appointment with Mirijam
3/4/20, 21:38 - Marco: Monday
3/4/20, 21:38 - Marco: But for tomorrow I didnt manage to have an idea so i wrote to Sara
3/4/20, 21:38 - Marco: I'm gonna be there, will show the research and what I'm going through
3/4/20, 21:38 - Marco: If she wants to hear
3/4/20, 21:38 - Marco: Not gonna risk my health on school anymore
3/4/20, 21:39 - Marco: I have to learn to say stop before it's too late
3/4/20, 21:39 - Marco: Yes
3/4/20, 21:45 - Marco: I understand your point of you, but I'll tell you openheartedly
3/4/20, 21:46 - Marco: First time I'm being honest to someone else (as well as to myself) about this
3/4/20, 21:47 - Marco: I know it is not KABK at all, KABK is a great school and I love basically everything about it and about how it works and what goes on in there. But liking something doesn't equal being good at it, and  more and more I'm having the confirmation that I am not fit for this school
3/4/20, 21:48 - Marco: I don't doubt that I have good technical capabilities
3/4/20, 21:48 - Marco: I acknowledge that and am very proud of it
3/4/20, 21:48 - Marco: But this is not what this school looks for
3/4/20, 21:48 - Marco: And to be honest I really don't understand sometimes why did they accept me in there
3/4/20, 21:49 - Marco: I'll elaborate
3/4/20, 21:49 - Marco: When I see everyone else in that school
3/4/20, 21:50 - Marco: Since the first day of the first year, I see that everyone has (even if really faint and not evident sometimes) a general direction or scope of interest
3/4/20, 21:50 - Marco: And their style and the things that they do moves along that invisible line
3/4/20, 21:50 - Marco: Until (4th year) hopefully that scope tightens until one has a quite distinct style and aim of what he's all about
3/4/20, 21:51 - Marco: Even if they don't have any technical capability at all
3/4/20, 21:52 - Marco: For me since the start it was the other way round, I started having a very good technical knowledge of very complex things, and preferred a style that is very aestethically clean and polished and designy
3/4/20, 21:52 - Marco: Which is the total opposite, and I even kinda knew that before joining, more the first thing out of the two
3/4/20, 21:52 - Marco: And I hoped since the start to find my own voice
3/4/20, 21:53 - Marco: But I cannot
3/4/20, 21:53 - Marco: I have a fuckload of interest
3/4/20, 21:53 - Marco: Interests
3/4/20, 21:53 - Marco: But dont commit to anything
3/4/20, 21:53 - Marco: I favor aesthetically pleasing results to meaningful ones
3/4/20, 21:53 - Marco: Make an example
3/4/20, 21:53 - Marco: If you have any
3/4/20, 21:54 - Marco: And keep in mind that I am not like crying or whining about these things rn haha
3/4/20, 21:54 - Marco: Compared to other times, I'm analyzing them with a very (I think) objective eye, I am not being invested emotionally
3/4/20, 21:55 - Marco: Definitive?
3/4/20, 21:55 - Marco: As in work
3/4/20, 21:55 - Marco: Or just as in jumping to conclusions
3/4/20, 21:56 - Marco: Yeah I cannot seem to avoid this and many other habits that normally an artist does not have
3/4/20, 21:56 - Marco: I can't seem to understand how to do that, sometimes it seems like my brain is wired this way
3/4/20, 21:57 - Marco: And it takes a lot of time to change something like this if I want to
3/4/20, 21:57 - Marco: Sorry for burping all of this stuff on you haha
3/4/20, 21:58 - Marco: If it's more than you can handle be honest, I can deal with it myself I think
3/4/20, 21:58 - Marco: Haha thanks
3/4/20, 21:58 - Marco: You know I'd do the same
3/4/20, 22:15 - Marco: Yeah but the problem is when this "moment" happens everytime I need to think of an idea, it got as far as feeling it go down and getting terrified whenever I know that I have to start thinking about an idea soon
3/4/20, 22:15 - Marco: And that may be, as you said, because I try to look for the definitive thing rather than building brick by brick
3/4/20, 22:15 - Marco: But I have two remarks about this
3/4/20, 22:17 - Marco: 1. This was already clear before I was admitted from my portfolio, which is why I do not understand sometimes why they got me in
3/4/20, 22:18 - Marco: And I have no idea how I got this far with such a wrong approach to the practice
3/4/20, 22:19 - Marco: I did the first year very very badly, basically wasted it to run behind wies and Roberto and I'm not giving them any responsability at all, I take full responsibility of that cause simply I didnt know any better
3/4/20, 22:20 - Marco: I have learned a lot from it and grew up incredibly as a person as a result, but not as an artist cause in the end I still wasted the first year, that is crucial to experiment in a less serious way
3/4/20, 22:20 - Marco: And find your path more comfortably, you are actually encouraged to do that
3/4/20, 22:21 - Marco: But now i wasted that chance and I wandered for too long in a place that I don't know well, and I have lost the path (sorry for sounding cheesy)
3/4/20, 22:21 - Marco: And I constantly feel very slow and behind everyone else, and I cannot go too slow on a highway
3/4/20, 22:22 - Marco: Otherwise others risk because of me
3/4/20, 22:22 - Marco: And I do that all the time, taking my frustration out on others
3/4/20, 22:22 - Marco: 5 minutes into an idea, i already ask others and tell them I can't figure out something
3/4/20, 22:22 - Marco: Hoping that they can give me a lead
3/4/20, 22:24 - Marco: I will talk to everyone is needed
3/4/20, 22:24 - Marco: Thanks for listening
3/4/20, 22:24 - Marco: Helped a lot
3/4/20, 22:27 - Marco: Yes but not so emotionally involved
3/4/20, 22:27 - Marco: <Media omitted>
3/4/20, 22:29 - Marco: Oh but there is some of my sentences
3/4/20, 22:30 - Marco: So that's how you felt back then?
3/4/20, 22:30 - Marco: Oh but man you are doing greay
3/4/20, 22:30 - Marco: Great
3/4/20, 22:31 - Marco: Like you're getting brilliant stuff out of that head everyday
3/4/20, 22:31 - Marco: I remember to be honest last year I thought of your stuff that it was 1/10000 of what it is now, it got so incredibly good it doesnt belong to that school almost haha
3/4/20, 22:32 - Marco: Understandable, but this is what i think of now
3/4/20, 22:32 - Marco: Your growth was exponential
3/4/20, 22:32 - Marco: Sometimes it is really genius
3/4/20, 22:32 - Marco: Johan dont know shit
3/4/20, 22:33 - Marco: Yeah I noticed
3/4/20, 22:34 - Marco: It comes and goes I guess
3/4/20, 22:34 - Marco: Can you recommend me something to watch to e n h a n c e my critical thinking
3/4/20, 22:35 - Marco: Yeah I cant do that, if my mental state could inspire me that would be amazing haha
3/4/20, 22:35 - Marco: Ja
3/4/20, 22:36 - Marco: Hahahah
3/4/20, 22:36 - Marco: Zoom

3/4/20, 22:37 - Marco: Just food for brain you know

3/5/20, 11:35 - Marco: So maybe it is more their problem than yours
3/5/20, 11:35 - Marco: Did they give you any direction

3/12/20, 15:46 - Lorenzo: Lol well where is that understanding Marco of last week ;P
3/12/20, 15:46 - Marco: well I understand doesn't mean that I can't be annoyed by her voice
3/12/20, 15:46 - Marco: because her voice is objectively annoying
3/12/20, 15:46 - Marco: doesn't mean that i hate her as a person
3/12/20, 15:47 - Marco: i don't know i didn't really pay attention to that tbh haha
3/12/20, 15:47 - Marco: "it's a pandemic!

3/12/20, 15:47 - Marco: WHO*
3/12/20, 15:47 - Marco: i'm glad i have someone in the class i can share my annoyances about other people in the class with
3/12/20, 15:49 - Marco: Hahahahahah
3/12/20, 15:49 - Marco: Arlight
3/12/20, 15:49 - Marco: <Media omitted>
3/12/20, 16:05 - Marco: My mom is faster than any news source
3/12/20, 16:05 - Marco: ☹
3/12/20, 16:05 - Marco: Mom jokes are overrated
3/12/20, 16:06 - Marco: Until 26 we don't have any
3/12/20, 16:06 - Marco: Not possible for me
3/12/20, 16:07 - Marco: Not really a wise decision if I have to be honest, to keep school open
3/12/20, 16:07 - Marco: I mean personally I'm happy
3/12/20, 16:07 - Marco: Cause I got stuff to do and I hate my roommate
3/12/20, 16:08 - Marco: But objectively not really smart
3/12/20, 16:09 - Marco: No they said no
3/12/20, 16:09 - Marco: They said they can be played but with no more than 100 people
3/12/20, 16:09 - Marco: Lol
3/12/20, 16:09 - Marco: Idc anyway

3/12/20, 16:17 - Marco: Lol
3/12/20, 16:18 - Marco: I've been thinking for the whole week
3/12/20, 16:18 - Marco: I hate how corona is a name that doesn't lend itself to puns
3/12/20, 16:18 - Marco: You can't make a pun with it
3/12/20, 16:19 - Marco: Should I call you Louis M.Q. from now on
3/12/20, 16:19 - Marco: How am I ever supposed to know

3/12/20, 16:20 - Marco: <Media omitted>
3/12/20, 16:21 - Marco: Hahahahah
3/12/20, 16:21 - Marco: The world's best memers are on the situation
3/12/20, 17:27 - Marco: <Media omitted>
3/12/20, 17:56 - Marco: So many
3/12/20, 18:00 - Marco: Looks great
3/12/20, 18:39 - Marco: Hahahaha
3/12/20, 18:43 - Marco: Good news
3/12/20, 18:44 - Marco: <Media omitted>

3/12/20, 18:50 - Marco: <Media omitted>
3/12/20, 19:41 - Marco: She didn't mention it so there is gonna be class
3/12/20, 19:42 - Marco: they invited me to a photography party and I would like to go and meet new people and such
3/12/20, 19:42 - Marco: But also the introvert/insecure part of me is taking over
3/12/20, 19:42 - Marco: ufff
3/12/20, 20:21 - Marco: yeah it makes little sense
3/12/20, 20:21 - Marco: it's not too crowded but i'm not gonna go
3/12/20, 20:22 - Marco: lol
3/12/20, 20:48 - Marco: What is this hahaha
3/12/20, 20:49 - Marco: Very
3/13/20, 12:15 - Marco: Well it was the most important month of this year for me
3/13/20, 12:15 - Marco: So kinda "meh" but can't do anything about it
3/13/20, 12:16 - Marco: I mean that this month i had the spacesuit thing and the instrument thing
3/13/20, 12:16 - Marco: But all cancelled
3/13/20, 12:16 - Marco: Yeah that's what I said
3/13/20, 12:16 - Marco: I didn't
3/13/20, 12:17 - Marco: Weird times really
3/13/20, 12:20 - Marco: There is also nothing you can do about that
3/13/20, 12:20 - Marco: As much as you can't do anything for coronavirus
3/13/20, 12:20 - Marco: People can't really be blamed for ignorance i think
3/13/20, 12:20 - Marco: Yeah it is very interesting
3/13/20, 12:23 - Marco: Idk, personally I've been taking so many breaks I think it's time to start doing stuff but something always happens lol
3/13/20, 12:24 - Marco: <Media omitted>
3/13/20, 12:24 - Marco: And they put an option in the app for "contactless delivery"
3/13/20, 12:25 - Marco: It's not mean but makes little sense, there is no caution measure that has more relevance than another
3/13/20, 12:25 - Marco: Anything you can do is equally important
3/13/20, 12:25 - Marco: In your ordinary life

3/16/20, 20:07 - Marco: cause again in the coffeeshop they said that the government said they can open again
3/16/20, 20:07 - Marco: but it doesn't say anything in the statement about it so i'm maybe missing something?

3/19/20, 20:57 - Marco: Ja sure
3/19/20, 20:58 - Marco: My question was
3/19/20, 20:58 - Marco: I had others too but main was
3/19/20, 20:58 - Marco: That my recommendations for example take not only from my interests but also just what's popular/trending
3/19/20, 20:59 - Marco: And I was wondering if he tackled that, but that's really technical
3/19/20, 20:59 - Marco: on a more "ethical" standpoint, I was wondering what made him divide the "youtube population" in those categories, like what is the research that he conducted to get to these categorizations
3/19/20, 21:00 - Marco: And if it is not a bit reductive to just "call out" the conspiracists, the toddlers etc.
3/19/20, 21:03 - Marco: I mean I don't care about "micheal jackson's drummer performing smooth criminal' (actually popped up in my recommendations)
3/19/20, 21:04 - Marco: <Media omitted>
3/19/20, 21:05 - Marco: I didn't get it :(

3/20/20, 11:05 - Marco: I need your musical wisdom
3/20/20, 11:05 - Marco: So when I make music I often get stuck in the "loopitis" syndrome
3/20/20, 11:05 - Marco: like, I have tons of nice loops I made but I never can get out of it and make a full song
3/20/20, 11:05 - Marco: So do you know maybe good music to listen to to learn interesting structures, opening, closings, arrangements etc.
3/20/20, 11:08 - Marco: that's some brutal knobbing right there
3/20/20, 11:09 - Marco: <Media omitted>

3/20/20, 11:14 - Marco: still figuring out how to "glue" the sounds of the drum rack together
3/20/20, 11:14 - Marco: They really make them sound like one thing
3/20/20, 11:14 - Marco: aphex twin also does that
3/20/20, 11:14 - Marco: hahahaha

3/27/20, 15:21 - Marco: lekkah
3/27/20, 15:30 - Marco: Smell of cherry with a slight bitter almond note. Fresh red wine, fruity, with good structure and pleasantly drinkable, to be served at room temperature, it matches well with pasta with beans, risotto(risi e bisi is a type of risotto recipe), tagliatelle with duck, but also with roasted meat and Asiago cheese
3/27/20, 15:30 - Marco: Where'd you find it haha
3/27/20, 15:36 - Marco: Wow
3/28/20, 11:50 - Marco: [3/28, 11:36] Jeroen: marcoo

3/28/20, 11:51 - Marco: Hahahaha
3/28/20, 11:51 - Marco: Np
3/28/20, 11:51 - Marco: Just wanted to share this jeroenness with you
3/28/20, 11:52 - Marco: For sure I built up 3 years of experience with this stuff and I'm gonna lay it on you in one day for free just out of compassion
3/28/20, 11:53 - Marco: God damn it
3/28/20, 11:53 - Marco: I really don't understand how he can have these peaks of lacking self-awareness
3/28/20, 11:54 - Marco: Like I can understand being direct but the limit bar should be a little lower than this
3/28/20, 11:56 - Marco: Ahahahahah true
3/28/20, 11:56 - Marco: Everyone was like "me too"
3/28/20, 11:56 - Marco: Ahahahahahahaha
3/28/20, 11:56 - Marco: This is dutchness at its finest imo
3/28/20, 11:57 - Marco: And not much for the directness of the question
3/28/20, 11:57 - Marco: But more for the "I'm accustomed to have everything and instantly so I'm sure that I can have everything easy and quick"
3/28/20, 11:58 - Marco: Yeah and I had the same with jeroen now
3/28/20, 11:58 - Marco: Exactly the same
3/28/20, 11:58 - Marco: Like, process of learning is special and very personal
3/28/20, 11:58 - Marco: You can't just lay it on another one wishing that they deliver it to you like a thuisbezorgd package
3/28/20, 11:59 - Marco: Sit your ass on the chair and work your way
3/28/20, 11:59 - Marco: Ahahahaha
3/28/20, 11:59 - Marco: BLOOD
3/28/20, 11:59 - Marco: NO PAIN NO GAIN
3/28/20, 11:59 - Marco: But for real
3/28/20, 11:59 - Marco: I never realized how much my culture teached me this until now
3/28/20, 12:00 - Marco: They really want it ready and easy
3/28/20, 12:00 - Marco: Me too

[3/28, 11:39] Marco: i know how to use ableton as much as you
[3/28, 11:40] Marco: the way you use them can't be teached though
[3/28, 11:40] Marco: just play around a lot

4/18/20, 15:08 - Marco: goddamn
4/18/20, 16:45 - Marco: Simple Simon ahahah
4/20/20, 09:42 - Marco: Can I share with you my unpopular opinion bout the 'rona
4/20/20, 09:43 - Marco: (Translated: do you care)
4/20/20, 09:44 - Marco: "A commercial"
4/20/20, 09:44 - Marco: I saw you shared Lubach (didnt watch it though)
4/20/20, 09:45 - Marco: Ironic
4/20/20, 09:46 - Marco: Did they debunk her on the spot
4/20/20, 09:46 - Marco: Mmmmmmmhhh
4/20/20, 09:47 - Marco: <Media omitted>
4/20/20, 09:47 - Marco: Noice
4/20/20, 09:47 - Marco: I'm gonna paste my opinion
4/20/20, 09:47 - Marco: My opinion is not about the conspiracy though, even though that's part of what I say
4/20/20, 09:48 - Marco: Hahahaha
4/20/20, 09:48 - Marco: Lov it
4/20/20, 09:48 - Marco: ;()
4/20/20, 09:48 - Marco: We deserve every single death and repercussion from COVID-19.
4/20/20, 09:49 - Marco: Yes
4/20/20, 09:49 - Marco: That was a quick read
4/20/20, 09:49 - Marco: Hahaha
4/20/20, 09:51 - Marco: Oke take your time
4/20/20, 09:51 - Marco: I'mma showah
4/20/20, 10:23 - Marco: Gonna answer your answers
4/20/20, 10:24 - Marco: Starting from this, I agree, I'm seriously shaken by the things I see and read everyday and you clearly agree with me on this. On the other hand I can argument everything I said though
4/20/20, 10:26 - Marco: Not talking about china necessarily. I see how people act in everyday life here, and what I read about other places and I can't wrap my head around how immature of a behaviour everyone is adopting. China's silencing and wet markets are just a small part of the bigger problem, and I'm not saying it's easy to address but we don't even try, most of us seem not to even see the problem or to ignore it if they see it
4/20/20, 10:29 - Marco: Following what I said in the line before: when a kid does something wrong he learns from the consequences of the action and hopefully grows up and matures from that. The deaths and hospital overflow and economic crisis and unemployment are the consequences, and it is sad but they are the consequences of our own actions, and as such we should take responsibility for them, because to a good extent it's what we deserved from our irresponsible behaviour
4/20/20, 10:31 - Marco: And I'm talking about Gates and other experts having warned us for years that a pandemic was gonna show up soon and we were not prepared. But we did nothing about it and thought about other comparatively insignificant things that now show how unimportant they are because there is nothing important as this pandemic takes over our society
4/20/20, 10:31 - Marco: (gonna answer after lesson)
4/20/20, 10:33 - Marco: And we are not further than this because being further than this = having prevented it
4/20/20, 10:34 - Marco: It was only that haha finished
4/20/20, 10:34 - Marco: oh ok
4/20/20, 10:34 - Marco: ye
4/20/20, 10:37 - Marco: ahahahah
4/20/20, 10:43 - Marco: I have a question
4/20/20, 10:43 - Marco: The ideas my group is talking about today are my ideas
4/20/20, 10:44 - Marco: Is it ok if I say they are my ideas or I should say our
4/20/20, 10:44 - Marco: in your opinion
4/20/20, 10:44 - Marco: I'm really proud about them
4/20/20, 10:44 - Marco: And wanted to do a personal thing but figured out it was better to use it for this
4/20/20, 10:45 - Marco: Thank you!
4/20/20, 10:46 - Marco: AHahahahah
4/20/20, 10:47 - Marco: hahahaha

4/20/20, 10:56 - Marco: he's making me nervous
4/20/20, 10:56 - Marco: i mean the voice
4/20/20, 10:56 - Marco: and the way to say things
4/20/20, 10:57 - Marco: Yeah I understand

4/21/20, 12:20 - Marco: As if you're seeing it from the outside almost
4/21/20, 12:20 - Marco: So nice, but still frustrated about this whole situation
4/21/20, 12:21 - Marco: And I know that if I express my concerns to these teachers I'll get an aggressive comeback

4/21/20, 12:23 - Marco: Also, I want to ask you smth about this project
4/21/20, 12:24 - Marco: Because I've seen the other groups making sharp/clever critiques sometimes, such as the "naive" or the dildo thing
4/21/20, 12:24 - Marco: And our project as of know is very narrative but I have the feel that it lacks that "pointyness"
4/21/20, 12:25 - Marco: And I know you are really good at stuff like this, but I don't mean to put any pressure on you for this but it would be nice to think of including something like that as part of our thing
4/21/20, 12:25 - Marco: That's true
4/21/20, 12:25 - Marco: But you're super good at these kinda things and you dont make it cheezy
4/21/20, 12:25 - Marco: True
4/21/20, 12:26 - Marco: Had to translate witty
4/21/20, 12:26 - Marco: Yeah but does it have to be? It would be nice maybe to include some gertness ?
4/21/20, 12:26 - Marco: Yeah maybe you"re right
4/21/20, 12:26 - Marco: It"s a different kind of narrative
4/21/20, 12:27 - Marco: But it's more and more reflecting the absence of gert in the whole thing
4/21/20, 12:28 - Marco: And I don't want it to become so serious that people don't get much out of it at the end. And from witty stuff like evian or the dildo (to some extent because it's clever regarding the matter they address) you don't really get something more than a laugh which I agree with you
4/21/20, 12:29 - Marco: We are far ahead into giving deepness to our story but the whole "improvised building"ness that charachterized also last year's project is also a bit lacking imo
4/21/20, 12:29 - Marco: I know it is different
4/21/20, 12:29 - Marco: This time
4/21/20, 12:30 - Marco: But i think we could make it more """"edgy""""
4/21/20, 12:30 - Marco: Go
4/21/20, 12:38 - Marco: Yeah you are right
4/21/20, 12:38 - Marco: <Media omitted>
4/21/20, 12:42 - Marco: <Media omitted>
4/21/20, 12:45 - Marco: True
4/21/20, 12:45 - Marco: I have to control this getting emotional and blameful when I address my concerns haha
4/21/20, 12:53 - Marco: You're 100% right
4/21/20, 13:39 - Marco: Do you think we should make them notice that we have one less component
4/21/20, 13:39 - Marco: Sun Yin
4/21/20, 13:39 - Marco: Thanks
4/21/20, 13:41 - Marco: Wow

4/21/20, 19:41 - Marco: Just the last one
4/21/20, 19:42 - Marco: What do you think of all this
4/21/20, 19:46 - Marco: They do realize that the country has just entered the top 10 most infected and they are getting 1000 more infected a day right? Yesterday Grote Markt was as full of people as it is in a no-virus situation
4/21/20, 19:46 - Marco: I can understand, that goes for almost everyone
4/21/20, 19:47 - Marco: Which is why people are going out anyway
4/21/20, 19:47 - Marco: But they have to understand that if they act like this the times are gonna be longer
4/21/20, 19:47 - Marco: ?
4/21/20, 19:55 - Marco: Well sorry
4/21/20, 19:55 - Marco: Talk again when you have processed it then
4/22/20, 10:21 - Marco: Np, you were right
4/22/20, 11:00 - Marco: Wow hahahaha
4/22/20, 11:00 - Marco: Who's the actor playing gandalf
4/22/20, 11:49 - Marco: 3 people only

4/26/20, 15:46 - Marco: But I'm kinda done I only need a table with some shelves and I'm set, I've found the perfect one in Bleiswijk and I'm hoping Jeroen can help me with that as well

4/26/20, 21:44 - Marco: If it may be of any help for your research
4/26/20, 21:47 - Marco: I find it very interesting how all the major food chains (kfc, burger king, mcdonald's etc.) have all kinds of posters/papers/warning/leaflets outside their restaurant mentioning that "the restaurant is currently not fully operative" anf "sorry but at the moment we only offer delivery" without EVER mentioning the word covid or corona or virus or anything that can remotely remind people of a pandemic going on
4/26/20, 21:48 - Marco: Everything is written in a very "safe" way, to reassure people and make it look like it is only a small little tiny problem "for now we can only offew delivewy sowwy :c"
4/26/20, 22:54 - Marco: <Media omitted>

4/28/20, 11:42 - Marco: Kinda weird but ok
4/28/20, 11:49 - Marco: He wants to wait to ask cause "he doesn't want to ask too often something"
4/28/20, 11:49 - Marco: As in
4/28/20, 11:49 - Marco: He doesn't want to show too often he's in need
4/28/20, 11:49 - Marco: But none of my business actually

5/13/20, 20:27 - Marco: No do 2
5/13/20, 20:27 - Marco: It's more like a kill bill than a trilogy imo
5/13/20, 20:27 - Marco: Hahaha ye

5/15/20, 10:10 - Marco: I'm gonna listen in 5 mins
5/15/20, 10:11 - Marco: I'm literally not finding the time to do anything but the assignment for tuesday haha
5/15/20, 10:11 - Marco: I'm spending like 8 hours a day at least but I'm totally fine with it
5/15/20, 10:11 - Marco: I'm learning a lot and getting mad skills
5/15/20, 10:11 - Marco: And I have a lot of fun with it
5/15/20, 10:11 - Marco: If t wasn't for this I wouldn't spend all this time
5/15/20, 10:12 - Marco: I know but I really want to
5/15/20, 10:13 - Marco: Nono I agree but having a week to put together the sound and the video clips is better than doing it at the last day
5/15/20, 10:13 - Marco: As long as I keep my sanity is fine haha and I'm surprisingly keeping it
5/15/20, 10:13 - Marco: But I can't wait to show you guys
5/15/20, 10:14 - Marco: Wdym

5/15/20, 10:15 - Marco: Mmmh
5/15/20, 10:15 - Marco: Do you already have a plan how to do that?
5/15/20, 10:16 - Marco: If not it's ok but as soon as you have one tell me before doing it
5/15/20, 10:16 - Marco: Cause it might be that depending on the approach it has to be redone from scratch then haha
5/15/20, 10:16 - Marco: Full of love
5/15/20, 10:16 - Marco: Shit
5/15/20, 10:18 - Marco: Ahahha POH

5/15/20, 10:22 - Marco: imagine greeting your dad like that
5/15/20, 10:23 - Marco: ahahahah amazing
5/15/20, 10:24 - Marco: great improv
5/15/20, 10:25 - Marco: yesterday i also managed to connect the bass to the sound card
5/15/20, 10:25 - Marco: I was blown away, so good
5/15/20, 10:25 - Marco: yess
5/15/20, 10:25 - Marco: no
5/15/20, 10:25 - Marco: That socket was both for xlr and jack cable haha
5/15/20, 10:26 - Marco: my roommate showed me
5/15/20, 10:26 - Marco: he just plugged the jack cable in the xlr plug and I was like "oh"
5/15/20, 10:26 - Marco: haha
5/15/20, 10:26 - Marco: ;)
5/15/20, 10:26 - Marco: It was tight enough
5/15/20, 10:27 - Marco: The jack cable fit perfectly
5/15/20, 10:27 - Marco: There was connection

5/15/20, 10:51 - Marco: hahahah agree
5/15/20, 10:51 - Marco: but i remember the emo scene was huge back then
5/15/20, 10:51 - Marco: and i thought it died right after

5/17/20, 10:57 - Marco: Thanks s
5/17/20, 10:57 - Marco: nostalgia motor
5/17/20, 10:58 - Marco: yeah ofc
5/17/20, 11:12 - Marco: never seen it
5/17/20, 11:13 - Marco: hahaha wow
5/17/20, 11:34 - Marco: Ahahaha how was this called
5/17/20, 11:34 - Marco: Bitmoji or something
5/17/20, 19:40 - Marco: ahahah
5/18/20, 08:58 - Marco: Says a lot about the actual class rep
5/18/20, 09:03 - Marco: Well if you wanna
5/18/20, 09:03 - Marco: Personally I don't see a reason why I would do it
5/18/20, 09:10 - Marco: So
5/18/20, 09:14 - Marco: What does this have to do with class representation
5/18/20, 09:15 - Marco: Yeah but we know that from a while now
5/18/20, 09:16 - Marco: And wies is certainly not the best person to mitigate the problem
5/18/20, 09:17 - Marco: That's also what I was thinking of when I said I see no reason to do it
5/18/20, 09:18 - Marco: As long as there is so much egoism and egocentrism in our class there is no class
5/18/20, 09:18 - Marco: There is literally no interest from anyone in creating a community
5/18/20, 09:18 - Marco: And you becoming a representative means that you always have to seek the crumbles of sense of community that sometimes are left on the path
5/18/20, 09:19 - Marco: Yeah
5/18/20, 09:19 - Marco: <Media omitted>
5/18/20, 09:20 - Marco: [5/17, 18:56] Jeroen: heyy sorry celebrating my dad's birthday
5/18/20, 09:21 - Marco: This is the status quo
5/18/20, 09:21 - Marco: And if I cared about my mental health I wouldn't wanna represent these people
5/18/20, 09:22 - Marco: Also considering the other representative is a still stuck-in-high-school manipulator
5/18/20, 09:22 - Marco: I really would leave it be if I was you
5/18/20, 09:23 - Marco: Heardn't haha
5/18/20, 09:24 - Marco: I can't wait to fill in that self-evaluation form
5/18/20, 09:25 - Marco: What makes a class rep is that + gathering a (hopefully) unanimous opinion + taking a decision
5/18/20, 09:25 - Marco: And the last two things are near impossible
5/18/20, 09:26 - Marco: It was already like this last year when I was class rep
5/18/20, 09:26 - Marco: And this year it worsened
5/18/20, 09:27 - Marco: Ye
5/18/20, 09:31 - Marco: Hahaha nice
5/18/20, 09:36 - Marco: Yees

5/18/20, 14:16 - Marco: Kinda looks like a pussy tbh
5/18/20, 14:16 - Marco: Especially the way we want it to be handled
5/18/20, 14:18 - Marco: Ahahahahh you see
5/18/20, 14:18 - Marco: 4 fingers in that puss
5/18/20, 14:18 - Marco: Conch

5/18/20, 14:23 - Marco: Senshuall
5/18/20, 14:24 - Marco: We're gonna shell it for a few bucks
5/18/20, 14:24 - Marco: Stop with that grin
5/18/20, 14:24 - Marco: Hahaha
5/18/20, 14:25 - Marco: Get that smile off yo face

5/18/20, 14:27 - Marco: 10/10
5/18/20, 14:27 - Marco: I actually think that Soshell came out from one of us during a meeting
5/18/20, 14:27 - Marco: Not me though
5/18/20, 14:27 - Marco: Probably simbu

5/27/20, 18:27 - Marco: I also thought about it and it may be that I took too much on myself for this project
5/27/20, 18:29 - Marco: At the same time I think putting works from different sources together wouldn't have sorted the same feedback/result from the teachers and everyone else
5/27/20, 18:29 - Marco: This not to say that I made it better
5/27/20, 18:29 - Marco: But to say that it would have not been coherent and uniform
5/27/20, 18:29 - Marco: And I think that's better but that's my personal opinion
5/27/20, 18:30 - Marco: I'm just a bit disappointed on myself that too much of it was on me
5/27/20, 18:30 - Marco: And I brought it myself
5/27/20, 18:37 - Marco: Workin, gonna listen as soon as I have time

5/29/20, 09:55 - Marco: this is hilarious
5/29/20, 10:37 - Marco: Remus is really great
5/29/20, 10:37 - Marco: I think he is my favorite teacher this year
5/29/20, 10:38 - Marco: So on point every time, so professional and quite funny
5/29/20, 10:38 - Marco: Lacks a bit of empathy sometimes haha
5/29/20, 10:38 - Marco: But as a teacher he is top notch imo
5/29/20, 10:39 - Marco: I'm not judging him as a person
5/29/20, 10:39 - Marco: I don't like many aspects of his personality
5/29/20, 10:39 - Marco: But professionally he is impeccable
5/29/20, 10:40 - Marco: Well yeah he hasn't taken a wrong step since the start I think
5/29/20, 10:40 - Marco: And he teaches it well
5/29/20, 10:40 - Marco: He is also strict enough for my standards
5/29/20, 10:40 - Marco: Which is quite strict but not too much
5/29/20, 10:41 - Marco: You have to get your ass on the chair and focus and work to understand what he teaches
5/29/20, 10:41 - Marco: But if you do it is very rewarding
5/29/20, 10:41 - Marco: Especially on the long run
5/29/20, 10:43 - Marco: Well it's a damn art academy i wouldn't expect otherwise
5/29/20, 10:46 - Marco: Impeccable means that I don't have any remark on his way of teaching from the very first lesson
5/29/20, 10:47 - Marco: Not even a detail
5/29/20, 10:47 - Marco: That's my definition of impeccable
5/29/20, 10:48 - Marco: Perfect = no mistakes
5/29/20, 10:48 - Marco: And he didnt make any imo
5/29/20, 10:48 - Marco: Or for what concerns mean
5/29/20, 10:48 - Marco: Me*
5/29/20, 10:48 - Marco: Wtf
5/29/20, 10:49 - Marco: Maybe in a longer timeframe he will and I will readjust my judgement
5/29/20, 10:49 - Marco: But almost a whole semester is long enough for me
5/29/20, 10:50 - Marco: Duly noted

5/29/20, 10:54 - Marco: Hahahaha
5/29/20, 10:54 - Marco: Lyrical spiritual miracle
5/29/20, 10:54 - Marco: Wat is lelijk
5/29/20, 10:55 - Marco: It comes from a god
5/29/20, 10:55 - Marco: Greek

5/31/20, 14:23 - Marco: More capitalistic than putting the company logo and font? :O

5/31/20, 14:31 - Marco: Ahahahaha
5/31/20, 14:32 - Marco: Nice

6/4/20, 13:20 - Marco: also if you need help/recommendations on how to host and publish your thing you can ask mee
6/4/20, 13:20 - Marco: yeah but it's still relevant

6/7/20, 12:22 - Marco: do we have a tagline
6/7/20, 12:22 - Marco: ?
6/7/20, 12:22 - Marco: "touch at a distance"?
6/7/20, 12:22 - Marco: (jeroen)
6/7/20, 12:22 - Marco: for fuck's sake
6/7/20, 12:22 - Marco: how d
6/7/20, 12:22 - Marco: how the fuck do people like this get in art academies
6/7/20, 12:22 - Marco: like wtf
6/7/20, 12:22 - Marco: the amount of non-effort
6/7/20, 12:23 - Marco: fucking hell
6/7/20, 12:23 - Marco: but how
6/7/20, 12:23 - Marco: can you be so not creative
6/7/20, 12:23 - Marco: like he didn't even try
6/7/20, 12:23 - Marco: it's like we're advertising a sink and his tagline is "get water. Sink"
6/7/20, 12:24 - Marco: and this is even creative cause it has sort of a double ,meaning
6/7/20, 12:24 - Marco: see even if I try I can't amount to his total carelessness and elementarity
6/7/20, 12:24 - Marco: sorry if I sound arrogant
6/7/20, 12:24 - Marco: but for real wtf
6/7/20, 12:25 - Marco: idk it just irritates me
6/7/20, 12:25 - Marco: cause it doesn't stimulate me at all
6/7/20, 12:25 - Marco: like wtf if this is the standard
6/7/20, 12:25 - Marco: ffs
6/7/20, 12:25 - Marco: i'm seriously questioning if i should join next year
6/7/20, 12:26 - Marco: how does he not see it
6/7/20, 12:26 - Marco: how absolutely bland what he says and does is
6/7/20, 12:26 - Marco: goddamn it
6/7/20, 12:28 - Marco: not only because of him
6/7/20, 12:28 - Marco: ofc
6/7/20, 12:28 - Marco: also because they are planning alternate days lessons
6/7/20, 12:29 - Marco: and the dynamics of our class I can't stand
6/7/20, 12:29 - Marco: it's him, wies, roberto etc.
6/7/20, 12:29 - Marco: no i don't, i don't even see these people these days
6/7/20, 12:29 - Marco: yeah may be
6/7/20, 12:30 - Marco: but what I'm saying I've been thinking for a while and it's faxxx
6/7/20, 12:30 - Marco: and facts don't care about my feelings you kno
6/7/20, 12:30 - Marco: yes i am quoting ben shapiro
6/7/20, 12:31 - Marco: it is a fact that I don't wanna pay the same price for half the school, of which one half is with people I can't really stand and in a class that can't work together towards a goal
6/7/20, 12:39 - Marco: no but back then it was different. I still want to finish the school and I think I am capable of doing it (especially when I see things like this ^). But I am getting graded on this shitty project as well and I don't want my grade and work and portfolio to be fucked up by these people that put no effort if not into manipulating others to get something in return
6/7/20, 12:40 - Marco: Also, if we have school for half the days, I have the right to not accept doing it if it has to cost the same
6/7/20, 12:40 - Marco: I'd rather take a gap year and do some experience
6/7/20, 12:40 - Marco: which i feel like I lack
6/7/20, 12:40 - Marco: and then come back enriched
6/7/20, 12:41 - Marco: <Media omitted>
6/7/20, 12:41 - Marco: for sure, didn't take any final decision
6/7/20, 12:41 - Marco: just considering it
6/7/20, 12:41 - Marco: i have time until august to decide
6/7/20, 12:41 - Marco: yes
6/7/20, 12:42 - Marco: hahahah
6/7/20, 12:43 - Marco: not sure if I wanna be defined as an IMD art warrior ever in my life but I appreciate the words and I let them guide me through this day
6/7/20, 12:43 - Marco: that obviously is starting in the worst way

6/8/20, 19:44 - Marco: No I don't know anything about it, did I say the opposite?
6/8/20, 19:44 - Marco: You should look for hosting and domain mediawiki
6/8/20, 19:44 - Marco: Possibly free ig
6/8/20, 19:44 - Marco: Even though we maybe have a budget for collectives
6/8/20, 19:45 - Marco: Perfect
6/8/20, 19:45 - Marco: There must be a way to just directly upload the media wiki on the host and just link it
6/8/20, 19:45 - Marco: I don't think it's too difficult or different from a regular project
6/8/20, 19:47 - Marco: Ye

9/15/20, 19:17 - Marco: Because she really wrote the e-mail only for the people that were there at the lesson

9/16/20, 09:07 - Marco: Mhmh
9/16/20, 09:08 - Marco: Cause I'm looking with interest at the last one
9/16/20, 09:08 - Marco: Future Framing
9/16/20, 09:08 - Marco: I think would be really useful and would help me put things into perspective in this time where I'm uncertain about this path
9/16/20, 09:08 - Marco: And I also wanna do a practical one
9/16/20, 09:09 - Marco: Either the Studio Photography one or the Publication one
9/16/20, 09:09 - Marco: Yes I saw
9/16/20, 09:09 - Marco: So even convenient
9/16/20, 09:09 - Marco: Now I'm trying to choose between this two
9/16/20, 09:09 - Marco: Tell me
9/16/20, 09:11 - Marco: Are you sure that that course is gonna go beyond that aspect that you know?

9/16/20, 09:12 - Marco: Starts at 10 right?
9/16/20, 09:13 - Marco: Yeah both of em but I think the second one more
9/16/20, 09:13 - Marco: Cause the first one I feel like it's a bit of a dead end
9/16/20, 09:13 - Marco: You do that and it's that
9/16/20, 09:13 - Marco: The unity one opens up possibilities
9/16/20, 09:13 - Marco: Ye
9/16/20, 09:13 - Marco: Whereas the Waag one is mostly an endpoint
9/16/20, 09:14 - Marco: Haha yeah but I wouldn't do it either
9/16/20, 09:14 - Marco: I really feel like it has little to do with MadMax
9/16/20, 09:15 - Marco: You have to create a short film or smth, with a presentation at the Eye filmmuseum at some point
9/16/20, 09:15 - Marco: Sarah did it last year i think
9/16/20, 09:15 - Marco: Seemed like a loootta work

9/16/20, 09:17 - Marco: It felt like working on a distance even when I was there

9/16/20, 09:33 - Marco: Sounds a bit like micheal scott talking to jan
9/16/20, 09:33 - Marco: In the first seasons

I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

1/14/21, 11:34 - Marco: Again, tell the people responsible haha
1/14/21, 11:35 - Marco: There was a lot of work and correction done only by two people, if something slipped up it's not a big deal
1/14/21, 11:35 - Marco: Honestly
1/14/21, 11:39 - Marco: I respect how you feel about it, I think you're right
1/14/21, 11:40 - Marco: But again, the workload we've been under in the past two days is quite insane for two people
1/14/21, 11:40 - Marco: And something might have slipped up
1/14/21, 11:40 - Marco: So I understand it is frustrating but also understand that there was a very high probability that something like this could have happened
1/14/21, 11:41 - Marco: And much more probably happened on other texts as well
1/14/21, 11:41 - Marco: Cause to do all this stuff in two days is insane
1/14/21, 11:43 - Marco: Absofuckinglutely

1/25/21, 12:30 - Marco: It seems like they are doing the school a favor to be there
1/25/21, 12:30 - Marco: Whenever there is work involved there is someone that is like "but do we really have to do all that work?"
1/25/21, 12:40 - Marco: I think we can do it if everyone thinks about making something good together rather than pushing their own thing
1/25/21, 12:40 - Marco: And on that note thank god the bitch ass nr.1 isn't here

3/3/21, 13:18 - Marco: but those kind of playlist are location based
3/3/21, 13:18 - Marco: meaning, what are the people in that region listening to mostly
3/3/21, 13:18 - Marco: discover weekly is based on what you listen
3/3/21, 13:18 - Marco: and sure many times it is similar things to what you already have but sometimes it gives some gems
3/3/21, 13:19 - Marco: for me it gives really niche and varied results

3/15/21, 12:15 - Marco: Ok
3/15/21, 12:15 - Marco: Okok
3/15/21, 12:16 - Marco: She sounds a bit pretentious tbh
3/15/21, 12:16 - Marco: Yeah
3/15/21, 12:23 - Marco: Yeah hahaha
3/15/21, 12:23 - Marco: On that I have to agree with johan
3/15/21, 12:23 - Marco: Or an economist
3/15/21, 12:23 - Marco: He is a glorified lamp technician
3/15/21, 12:24 - Marco: But yeah very good thought
3/15/21, 12:26 - Marco: Hahaha I don't think she's on that wavelength
3/15/21, 12:26 - Marco: She's pretty coherent
3/15/21, 12:27 - Marco: okok
3/15/21, 12:27 - Marco: Ahahahahaha
3/15/21, 12:28 - Marco: It feels like she has a very clear mindset tho
3/15/21, 12:28 - Marco: She blurts stuff like a waterfall
3/15/21, 12:29 - Marco: Yeah
3/15/21, 12:29 - Marco: Yeah me too but you really have to stay behind it
3/15/21, 12:29 - Marco: As in, really actively pay a lot of attention
3/15/21, 12:29 - Marco: She has a fast train of thought
3/15/21, 12:30 - Marco: NICE
3/15/21, 12:30 - Marco: The word play
3/15/21, 12:30 - Marco: Self i.e.
3/15/21, 12:31 - Marco: No

3/15/21, 12:33 - Marco: Yeah
3/15/21, 12:35 - Marco: Hahahaha
3/15/21, 12:41 - Marco: This is literally putting an etiquette on yourself
3/15/21, 12:47 - Marco: Yeah
3/15/21, 12:47 - Marco: Idk if you're sarcastic or not with the pronoun anymore
3/15/21, 12:48 - Marco: Ok
3/15/21, 12:50 - Marco: I'm not complaining about it
3/15/21, 12:50 - Marco: I just really don't care, I'm not putting any gendering significance on pronouns I use for people
3/15/21, 12:50 - Marco: It's just a word
3/15/21, 12:52 - Marco: Idempathy
3/15/21, 12:53 - Marco: "You're not your identity" but then why does she state her pronouns as the first thing
3/15/21, 12:53 - Marco: Maybe I'm not seeing this right
3/15/21, 12:54 - Marco: I'm not enough into the sexuality/gender discourse (yet) to really say something about it I feel
3/15/21, 13:01 - Marco: Yeah i agree
3/15/21, 13:01 - Marco: But it's because I'm ignorant about it
3/15/21, 13:01 - Marco: And I come from a background that is ignorant about it
3/15/21, 13:01 - Marco: And this in my background is the normal reaction to this discourse
3/15/21, 13:01 - Marco: Yeah that's the consequence of ignorance
3/15/21, 13:04 - Marco: Yeah this is stubborn ignorance
3/15/21, 13:06 - Marco: Why do people from our class push their own agenda in these qnas haha
3/15/21, 13:06 - Marco: Hahaha
3/15/21, 13:06 - Marco: It feels like self-validation
3/15/21, 13:07 - Marco: Hahaha yeah

3/15/21, 13:09 - Marco: Jeroen

3/26/21, 09:09 - Marco: <Media omitted>
3/26/21, 09:10 - Marco: Ye
3/26/21, 09:13 - Marco: Yeah it's a matter of patience
3/26/21, 11:33 - Marco: i kno
3/26/21, 11:33 - Marco: but
3/26/21, 11:33 - Marco: janine didnt start it yet
3/26/21, 11:36 - Marco: lol speak of the devil
3/26/21, 12:05 - Marco: well maybe because you're never there
3/26/21, 12:06 - Marco: you can make connections if you really want to
3/26/21, 12:06 - Marco: i'm not shaming
3/26/21, 12:06 - Marco: it's a statement of fact
3/26/21, 12:07 - Marco: she's never there, hence she doesn't feel very attached to it
3/26/21, 12:08 - Marco: how come, she very often talks about collaborative projects and creating communities
3/26/21, 12:08 - Marco: what
3/26/21, 12:09 - Marco: uhm ok
3/26/21, 12:13 - Marco: yeah may be
3/26/21, 12:14 - Marco: my personal experience is that I suffer from strong social anxiety, I even take medication for it, but still I make connections if I want to, and that's because I try and participate in the school life in what I'm interested
3/26/21, 12:14 - Marco: She's very social as she said
3/26/21, 12:14 - Marco: yes wait
3/26/21, 12:14 - Marco: let me finish
3/26/21, 12:15 - Marco: I'm not, I'm commenting what she said, which is "I am very social", and she is very often talks about fostering communities in her projects, and about working together and collectivities
3/26/21, 12:15 - Marco: Yet she is taking a critical stance on the way kabk community interacts yet she's there like 10% of the time
3/26/21, 12:16 - Marco: which makes me find her comment kinda hypocritical
3/26/21, 12:16 - Marco: this is my opinion, you may disagree ofc
3/26/21, 12:19 - Marco: hahahah
3/26/21, 12:20 - Marco: how does he even have a molecule of oxygen in his lungs to fucking play hockey
3/26/21, 12:20 - Marco: with all those cigs

3/28/21, 11:08 - Marco: But I didnt know what did she tell you
3/28/21, 11:08 - Marco: Also it's crazy that they still didnt send this fucking render
3/28/21, 11:08 - Marco: I'm sorry you felt like that thought
3/28/21, 11:09 - Marco: I was out of there mentally so I didn't really take the lead in saying 'so what is everyone here for"
3/28/21, 11:09 - Marco: Yeah can imagine

3/28/21, 11:10 - Marco: I also didnt understand why they were keeping you there
3/28/21, 11:10 - Marco: But also not very present to do something about it
3/28/21, 11:11 - Marco: Wdym
3/28/21, 11:14 - Marco: I don't think that you care to much, I think it's the rest that cares too little
3/28/21, 11:40 - Marco: Yeah ofc
3/28/21, 11:40 - Marco: What you said make sense but I think your 4th year vision is too romantic

7/28/21, 16:03 - Marco: He always still the scene
7/28/21, 16:03 - Marco: Steals*
7/28/21, 16:04 - Marco: Even in the outtakes
7/28/21, 16:04 - Marco: Yee but she becomes more of a gimmick after a while
7/28/21, 16:04 - Marco: I would have preferred a better carachter arc/evolution for her
7/28/21, 16:04 - Marco: Like what happened with ron
7/28/21, 16:05 - Marco: I feel like with april they rushed everything and there was little for her to evolve into
7/28/21, 16:06 - Marco: No just thinking
7/28/21, 16:06 - Marco: Ahahaha
7/28/21, 16:06 - Marco: He also had a super nice character arc
7/28/21, 16:06 - Marco: From a awkward nerd to a cool nerd
7/28/21, 16:06 - Marco: Yes but he is better in the first seasons I feel
7/28/21, 16:06 - Marco: Then he has a bleak aura for some reason
7/28/21, 16:06 - Marco: That is LITERALLY the best thing you could say
7/28/21, 16:07 - Marco: My favorite person in the whole world
7/28/21, 16:07 - Marco: Ahahahaha

8/10/21, 12:54 - Marco: I agree, I gave my house a overhaul last week and it feels so much like home now
8/10/21, 12:54 - Marco: More than my house here in italy
8/10/21, 12:55 - Marco: <Media omitted>
8/10/21, 12:55 - Marco: Yesss
8/10/21, 13:04 - Marco: No the opposite unfortunately

8/10/21, 13:05 - Marco: Gezelligness
8/10/21, 13:05 - Marco: Sounds familiar
8/10/21, 16:17 - Marco: Reminds me of the basic fucktard redditor saying "g e k o l o n i s e e r d" under every post concerning the netherlands
8/10/21, 16:17 - Marco: True
8/10/21, 17:00 - Marco: Keus?

8/12/21, 00:49 - Marco: I spotted peanut butter on my shower rack, is that a dutch thing to do?
8/12/21, 00:51 - Marco: Italians olive oil like they like their women
8/12/21, 00:51 - Marco: IN THE KITCHEN
8/12/21, 00:51 - Marco: jk
8/12/21, 00:52 - Marco: But also kind of a fact
8/12/21, 00:54 - Marco: Or italian
8/12/21, 00:55 - Marco: Also I'm pretty sure that you can get the equivalent of a kroket / bitterbal almost anywhere decently civilized
8/12/21, 00:55 - Marco: And frikandel is disgusting
8/12/21, 00:55 - Marco: Maybe hot dog is the closest thing to it
8/12/21, 00:55 - Marco: Which is also disgusting
8/12/21, 00:56 - Marco: Ahahahah
8/12/21, 00:56 - Marco: Piet patat
8/12/21, 00:56 - Marco: In the hague
8/12/21, 00:56 - Marco: Zwarte patat
8/12/21, 00:57 - Marco: It is rotterdamse no?
8/12/21, 00:57 - Marco: It is quite good, although my favorite one in the hague is another one
8/12/21, 00:57 - Marco: But they are somehow very different
8/12/21, 00:58 - Marco: And I understand why one would like either one over the other
8/12/21, 00:58 - Marco: Like bram ladage they clearly know how to make it almost perfect
8/12/21, 00:58 - Marco: It's really nicely dry frying
8/12/21, 00:58 - Marco: Not greasy at all
8/12/21, 00:58 - Marco: Which is rare
8/12/21, 00:59 - Marco: But there is this place in the hague that does them differently, I think many would argue that they are not nice either
8/12/21, 00:59 - Marco: Because they are very charged with flavor
8/12/21, 00:59 - Marco: And not as dry as bl
8/12/21, 00:59 - Marco: But very different, closer to Belgian fries perhaps
8/12/21, 01:00 - Marco: They are like crack
8/12/21, 01:00 - Marco: When you come to dh you should try
8/12/21, 01:00 - Marco: Also they have crazy mayos
8/12/21, 01:00 - Marco: Crazy mayos sounds nice
8/12/21, 01:01 - Marco: Thank you everyone we are the crazy mayos
8/12/21, 01:02 - Marco: Ahahahaha
8/12/21, 01:03 - Marco: Haha what is this
8/12/21, 01:03 - Marco: Ahahahahahha
8/12/21, 01:03 - Marco: Greasy tunes

9/10/21, 13:04 - Marco: yeah
9/10/21, 13:04 - Marco: definitely
9/10/21, 13:06 - Marco: I don't think that's the premise at all
9/10/21, 13:06 - Marco: you can't make of a film what the audience makes of it
9/10/21, 13:06 - Marco: yeah so all the discussions and the _redpilling_ stuff that came after it doesn't affect the film
9/10/21, 13:07 - Marco: it affects your view of the film if you let it
9/10/21, 13:07 - Marco: not the artwork itself
9/10/21, 13:07 - Marco: cause of money, but you have the choice not to watch it
9/10/21, 13:07 - Marco: and consider the first film as-is
9/10/21, 13:07 - Marco: a film
9/10/21, 13:09 - Marco: most of what you consume is that
9/10/21, 13:09 - Marco: I don't think it's a relevant argument haha
9/10/21, 13:09 - Marco: sorry
9/10/21, 13:10 - Marco: the fact that it's a product doesn't necessarily diminish the quality, it is what it is and contextualized it is an incredible film
9/10/21, 13:10 - Marco: my opinion is that it is not a relevant argument
9/10/21, 13:10 - Marco: but clearly we dont think the same
9/10/21, 13:11 - Marco: but we think the same that they are beating a dead horse with the 4tg
9/10/21, 13:11 - Marco: 4th
9/10/21, 13:11 - Marco: and that sucks, like what they did with star wars
9/10/21, 13:12 - Marco: animaniacs?

9/16/21, 20:28 - Marco: Daamn
9/16/21, 20:28 - Marco: Looks like a dumpling now
9/16/21, 20:29 - Marco: Ahahah ok more accurate
9/16/21, 20:30 - Marco: Wdym
9/16/21, 21:46 - Marco: was this an installation or
9/16/21, 21:48 - Marco: woow
9/16/21, 21:48 - Marco: so they swapped the letters
9/16/21, 21:48 - Marco: yeah
9/16/21, 21:48 - Marco: super cool
9/16/21, 21:52 - Marco: ahhahahah
9/16/21, 21:52 - Marco: I mean I saw airport signals in people's porches when i used to deliver
9/16/21, 21:57 - Marco: also sounds like train's late which I guess was somewhat intentional?
9/16/21, 21:59 - Marco: k
9/16/21, 22:00 - Marco: ahahahaha
9/16/21, 22:00 - Marco: rustic
9/16/21, 22:00 - Marco: rotisserie
9/16/21, 22:00 - Marco: rotisserie friend
9/16/21, 22:20 - Marco: woooo that's sick

9/16/21, 22:49 - Marco: scully and hitch

9/17/21, 12:04 - Marco: <Media omitted>
9/17/21, 12:06 - Marco: Ye
9/17/21, 12:09 - Marco: Yeah i have reshare store nearby but danke
9/17/21, 14:57 - Marco: <Media omitted>
9/17/21, 14:59 - Marco: Not much to understand
9/17/21, 15:05 - Marco: Or vice versa
9/17/21, 16:40 - Marco: <Media omitted>
9/17/21, 16:44 - Marco: I just bought the ticket
9/17/21, 16:44 - Marco: Damn it's in 6 months
9/17/21, 18:15 - Marco: me too!!
9/17/21, 18:15 - Marco: i dont hear anything
9/17/21, 18:16 - Marco: koole
9/17/21, 18:49 - Marco: good good
9/17/21, 18:57 - Marco: Agga?
9/17/21, 19:02 - Marco: was there the chance? haha
9/17/21, 19:02 - Marco: really ok
9/17/21, 19:03 - Marco: I didn't know you were in such good relationship with the switches haha
9/17/21, 19:07 - Marco: i was there
9/17/21, 19:07 - Marco: lol
9/17/21, 19:07 - Marco: kind of the reason why I don't want to go
9/17/21, 19:07 - Marco: there is this cultist trend which is getting scary tbh
9/17/21, 19:08 - Marco: I feel uncomfortable in a context like that
9/17/21, 19:08 - Marco: not only it's dumb, to me it's kinda scary
9/17/21, 19:08 - Marco: like really when someone gets brainwashed by a cult you know, then they become sort of zombies
9/17/21, 19:08 - Marco: with no critical thinking
9/17/21, 19:08 - Marco: it is kind of scary
9/17/21, 19:09 - Marco: no same
9/17/21, 19:09 - Marco: but the way they are approaching it is becoming exclusive and plain dumb
9/17/21, 19:09 - Marco: i don't like people who don't put themselves in discussion
9/17/21, 19:09 - Marco: or that just see their own view of things
9/17/21, 19:09 - Marco: and not the big picture
9/17/21, 20:15 - Marco: Omg me tooo 😳😳😳
9/17/21, 20:15 - Marco: I had sent some messages from my laptop before but my phone died
9/17/21, 19:13 - Marco: yeah exactly. I also believe somewhat in this but as a base I always have healthy doubt because I know I am not made to truly KNOW these things, I can just suppose. But they really are drifting in a dogmatic realm, like literally "I wanna create a religion" is what they say blatantly and I don't understand how can they say something like that without thinking twice about what it means
9/17/21, 19:14 - Marco: And all the negativity that the concept of religion brings with itself. Even wies yesterday mentioned the same but I think she is a bit more (luckily) "clueless" about what she is saying and she is smart enough not to follow up in the same brainless way these cunts are doing
9/17/21, 20:57 - Marco: there it is
9/17/21, 21:06 - Marco: heheheh
9/18/21, 09:57 - Marco: Idk i don't remember but still

9/19/21, 10:09 - Marco: "You are special, just like everyone else"
9/19/21, 10:15 - Marco: Damn if you've put in words anything there was to say about this lol
9/19/21, 10:15 - Marco: Everytime I'll be frustrated about jeroen I'll listen to this
9/19/21, 10:30 - Marco: i still need to watch the last episode lmao
9/19/21, 10:30 - Marco: yeah ahahah
9/19/21, 10:30 - Marco: and the screams are hilarious

9/19/21, 10:39 - Marco: interesting

9/22/21, 12:59 - Marco: It may be a topic that I touch too
9/22/21, 12:59 - Marco: Cause I wanna talk about the nurturing role of machines
9/22/21, 13:00 - Marco: Nuanced in what sense?
9/22/21, 13:06 - Marco: Please dont
9/22/21, 13:08 - Marco: Anna does virtue signaling a LOT
9/22/21, 13:09 - Marco: Why hannah
9/22/21, 13:11 - Marco: Mh ok

9/22/21, 13:31 - Marco: Magenta studio is AI music daw?
9/22/21, 14:16 - Marco: ?
9/22/21, 14:18 - Marco: Nice
9/22/21, 14:55 - Marco: Damn that was quick lol
9/22/21, 15:17 - Marco: It's so annoying how so many push their own desire for something while masking it as something good for everyone
9/22/21, 15:18 - Marco: As if people are stupid and not recognize it
9/22/21, 15:21 - Marco: Ahahaha you should sample that laugh and add it

9/22/21, 21:06 - Marco: What is written in the group is what was said
9/22/21, 21:48 - Marco: the "decisions are being made for me" kind of thing is the reason why I took it so seriously and asked people what they think
9/22/21, 21:48 - Marco: Because it is not good for anyone and don't worry, it's not gonna happen
9/22/21, 21:48 - Marco: we gon emancipate our selvez
9/22/21, 21:49 - Marco: Also don't take that party thing too seriously at all, it is just egocentric people trying to put up something to showcase their ego to everyone, don't even make it weight a bit in your everyday life
9/22/21, 21:49 - Marco: I don't even know if I'm gonna go
9/22/21, 21:49 - Marco: wat is deze
9/22/21, 21:49 - Marco: Speaking of the insecurity
9/22/21, 21:50 - Marco: I think you are on a very good track and you will find something that makes you feel more safe in what you are doing soon
9/22/21, 21:50 - Marco: It's 2 weeks in, no one expects you to be that far past point 0
9/22/21, 21:51 - Marco: So don't stress too much, look at what you are accomplishing and take a rest if needed
9/22/21, 21:51 - Marco: They did that once and it made things worse
9/22/21, 21:51 - Marco: So I'll leave it as is
9/22/21, 21:52 - Marco: still redemption song?

9/22/21, 22:26 - Marco: stand your ground and opt out if you feel like it's too much
9/22/21, 22:26 - Marco: STAND YOUR GROUND

10/1/21, 11:57 - Marco: https://hoodmaps.com/amsterdam-neighborhood-map
10/1/21, 11:57 - Marco: Sick
10/1/21, 12:01 - Marco: I'm also investigating invisible structures a lot
10/1/21, 12:02 - Marco: But not aimed to the netherlands
10/1/21, 12:02 - Marco: I recommend you see this
10/1/21, 12:17 - Marco: I guess it highlights the stereotypes that people have about each part of amsterdam
10/1/21, 12:18 - Marco: Yeah
10/1/21, 12:18 - Marco: Yep
10/1/21, 12:19 - Marco: Yeah i mean
10/1/21, 12:19 - Marco: You understand what it is
10/1/21, 12:20 - Marco: Pretty much
10/1/21, 12:20 - Marco: Pretty map
10/1/21, 13:00 - Marco: Ahahah it has that vibe indeed
10/1/21, 13:58 - Marco: Great job
10/1/21, 14:02 - Marco: Ahahahah
10/1/21, 14:02 - Marco: I love the little outdoors kitchen in the background
10/1/21, 14:02 - Marco: Very tradition
10/1/21, 15:38 - Marco: https://youtu.be/DNeH2iEEY6s
10/1/21, 15:41 - Marco: I fucking love Gus Johnson
10/1/21, 21:13 - Marco: https://youtu.be/TKfS5zVfGBc does this song tell you smth
10/1/21, 21:13 - Marco: Without looking at the comments
10/1/21, 21:16 - Marco: Ahaha warmer
10/1/21, 21:16 - Marco: You are getting warmer to what it is
10/1/21, 21:16 - Marco: Yeah sort of
10/1/21, 21:16 - Marco: It was on every tutorial from 2007 to 2010 haha
10/1/21, 21:17 - Marco: Like those ones with the people screen recording writing on the notepad
10/1/21, 21:17 - Marco: Yesss
10/1/21, 21:17 - Marco: I have such an emotional attachment to this song haha
10/1/21, 21:17 - Marco: The real deal
10/1/21, 21:19 - Marco: With?
10/2/21, 01:25 - Marco: I thought the good place was good but the first season finale makes it genius
10/2/21, 10:15 - Marco: The whole first season is about that place being the good place
10/2/21, 10:16 - Marco: But the season finale reveals that it is actually the bad place and Micheal is the master planner of that torture machine
10/2/21, 10:16 - Marco: He is also a really great charachter portrayed by a great actor
10/2/21, 10:17 - Marco: That sudden change in personality when he gets exposed is 🤌😘
10/2/21, 10:19 - Marco: I wont
10/2/21, 10:19 - Marco: I expect everything now
10/2/21, 10:19 - Marco: Aaah soo good
10/2/21, 10:19 - Marco: And shawn is kevin from b99
10/2/21, 10:19 - Marco: Cameo 2
10/2/21, 10:19 - Marco: Also
10/2/21, 10:20 - Marco: There is a micro-cameo when they show Jackson's friend while they try to rob the fast-food, when they hide Jackson in the safe
10/2/21, 10:20 - Marco: The safe says "Swanson safe company"
10/2/21, 10:20 - Marco: Yeah so much!!!
10/2/21, 10:20 - Marco: Also the start of the second season
10/2/21, 10:21 - Marco: Like i'm at the first episode of the second season
10/2/21, 10:21 - Marco: Janyu
10/2/21, 10:21 - Marco: Jason I mean
10/2/21, 10:21 - Marco: Jason mendoza
10/2/21, 10:21 - Marco: Ahahaha yeah
10/2/21, 10:21 - Marco: I love that before they reset them at the end of the second season
10/2/21, 10:22 - Marco: It's "ya basi-"
10/2/21, 10:22 - Marco: For sure
10/2/21, 10:22 - Marco: Yeah you are left with a feeling of uneasiness that there must be something wrong but the act is so good and goes on for so long that you forget about it
10/2/21, 10:23 - Marco: Until that cathartic point at the end, soo well written
10/2/21, 10:23 - Marco: Very ambitious compared to the other ones by Schur, but hell if it's well written
10/2/21, 10:24 - Marco: Ahahah yeah
10/2/21, 10:24 - Marco: True true
10/2/21, 10:25 - Marco: The premise of the charachter is amazing too
10/2/21, 10:25 - Marco: Like chidi especially
10/2/21, 10:25 - Marco: Being a professor in ethics doesnt make you an ethical person
10/2/21, 10:25 - Marco: Ahahah
10/2/21, 10:27 - Marco: Ahahah she is also a great charachter but I feel like there's more to her that still hasn't been revealed
10/2/21, 10:28 - Marco: That her motivations were corrupt was clear from the start
10/2/21, 10:28 - Marco: Maybe she was the big manifestation that something was not quite right in the "fake good place"
10/2/21, 10:29 - Marco: Ooh really
10/2/21, 10:29 - Marco: I will check
10/2/21, 10:29 - Marco: Ok ahah smart
10/2/21, 10:38 - Marco: Oh yeah i remember this person
10/2/21, 10:38 - Marco: I think you talked about it already
10/2/21, 10:40 - Marco: I understand
10/2/21, 10:40 - Marco: Weird shift
10/2/21, 10:41 - Marco: Yeah i understand but people change and it's ok to keep the distance if you feel like they don't reflect your values anymore
10/2/21, 10:41 - Marco: I did that earlier this year
10/2/21, 10:43 - Marco: Yeah I understand
10/2/21, 10:43 - Marco: But it is better to take distance and then see her again without any grudges
10/2/21, 11:42 - Marco: <Media omitted>
10/2/21, 11:44 - Marco: Yes thanks lol
10/2/21, 11:52 - Marco: <Media omitted>
10/2/21, 11:52 - Marco: <Media omitted>
10/2/21, 14:16 - Marco: and it was about antisemitism
10/2/21, 22:35 - Marco: Ahahaha psychoterapist janet sounds and looms like mirjam
10/3/21, 11:48 - Marco: <Media omitted>
10/3/21, 11:51 - Marco: <Media omitted>

10/3/21, 12:39 - Marco: Is it water
10/3/21, 12:41 - Marco: Sick haha
10/3/21, 12:41 - Marco: True you should film it with a macro lens
10/3/21, 12:42 - Marco: No it's good material for your graduation or thesis design maybe
10/3/21, 15:16 - Marco: I understand
10/3/21, 15:16 - Marco: Honestly the more time passes the less I am caring about this
10/3/21, 15:18 - Marco: I'll just propose it once I guess
10/3/21, 15:25 - Marco: Thanks for doing it
10/3/21, 15:27 - Marco: Ahahaha it was also difficult for me
10/3/21, 15:28 - Marco: Because I don't wanna come off as the guy who changes jeroen plans behind his back
10/3/21, 15:28 - Marco: Or talks shit behind his back when he can't answer
10/3/21, 15:28 - Marco: But also not my problem that he's gone
10/3/21, 15:30 - Marco: True
10/3/21, 16:28 - Marco: Somehow I am far from surprised
10/3/21, 16:30 - Marco: Yeah ofc
10/3/21, 16:34 - Marco: Ahahah
10/3/21, 16:34 - Marco: Everytime I read shoutout I imagine someone randomly opening their window and screaming
10/3/21, 16:34 - Marco: And then closing it promptly after
10/3/21, 16:35 - Marco: Exactly
