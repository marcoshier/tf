12/29/18, 14:07 - Marco: Hey Lorenzo, I wanted to ask you if you know the procedure for the insurance to pay for repairing my computer. When it dropped to the floor from the table the case broke and it's not attached anymore. The computer still works perfectly but I'm afraid that leaving the components exposed will lead them to degrade quickly and I want to avoid that since it's a new laptop. At first it was a little open but now it's cracking more and I don't want the inside components to be damaged by that. Of course I'm not angry or anything haha, don't worry at all, I just wanted to know if you already know the procedure and if we can figure it out after the collectives maybe? Cause I'll need the computer for those
12/29/18, 14:12 - Lorenzo: Oh damn..
12/29/18, 14:12 - Lorenzo: Ehm wait
12/29/18, 14:12 - Marco: Is it a big trouble?
12/29/18, 14:13 - Marco: I really hope not
12/29/18, 14:14 - Lorenzo: Ok ehmm
12/29/18, 14:14 - Lorenzo: Do you have a liability insurance?
12/29/18, 14:15 - Lorenzo: I'm reading your text now
12/29/18, 14:15 - Marco: Yes I do
12/29/18, 14:15 - Lorenzo: Well
12/29/18, 14:16 - Lorenzo: Ehmm
12/29/18, 14:16 - Lorenzo: Since it's a new laptop
12/29/18, 14:16 - Lorenzo: And it's
12/29/18, 14:16 - Lorenzo: Asus right
12/29/18, 14:16 - Marco: No it's a clevo
12/29/18, 14:16 - Lorenzo: Oh
12/29/18, 14:16 - Marco: I think that's the most troubling thing
12/29/18, 14:16 - Marco: Because
12/29/18, 14:17 - Marco: To be repaired without losing the warranty I have to send it in portugal
12/29/18, 14:17 - Lorenzo: Clevo?
12/29/18, 14:17 - Marco: Yes it's not a commercial brand
12/29/18, 14:17 - Marco: You don't have to rush
12/29/18, 14:17 - Lorenzo: Ehmm
12/29/18, 14:17 - Marco: We can talk about it when we get back tos chool
12/29/18, 14:17 - Lorenzo: Yeah I get it
12/29/18, 14:17 - Marco: Just wanted to let you know
12/29/18, 14:18 - Marco: Since I just got back in Den Haag
12/29/18, 14:19 - Marco: Unfortunately the computer is made in really shitty plastic and I hate it for that
12/29/18, 14:19 - Marco: I wouldn't have bothered you at all otherwise, but I know it's most likely gonna get worse for that haha
12/29/18, 14:20 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
12/29/18, 14:22 - Lorenzo: I think it's also different since I didn't do it on purpose
12/29/18, 14:22 - Marco: Yeah of course
12/29/18, 14:23 - Marco: I don't even know how much will the repairing cost because I have to send it first and then they will tell me
12/29/18, 14:23 - Lorenzo: Could you check your liability insurance for this
12/29/18, 14:23 - Lorenzo: Then I will look up mine
12/29/18, 14:23 - Marco: Okk but doesn't my liability insurance cover the damage I make for other people's things?
12/29/18, 14:23 - Marco: I will check it anyway ofc
12/29/18, 14:24 - Lorenzo: Yes it's a grey zone
12/29/18, 14:24 - Marco: Okk I'll check at the end of the holidays
12/29/18, 14:24 - Lorenzo: I haven't ever had this kind of experience
12/29/18, 14:24 - Marco: I'll call the insurance company directly
12/29/18, 14:25 - Lorenzo: And ehm if you need to send your laptop back
12/29/18, 14:25 - Marco: Okok I just thought you knew because you have this kind of insurance here and we have nothing like that in italy so I have no idea how it works haha
12/29/18, 14:25 - Lorenzo: You can borrow my laptop during the collectives
12/29/18, 14:25 - Marco: Do you think it's a problem if I send it after the collectives?
12/29/18, 14:25 - Lorenzo: Wait
12/29/18, 14:26 - Lorenzo: I will call my insurance now
12/29/18, 14:26 - Marco: Ok but you don't have to right now
12/29/18, 14:26 - Marco: Do it when you have time, don't bother too much unless waiting is a problem for the insurance
12/29/18, 14:26 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
12/29/18, 14:27 - Marco: Okok
12/29/18, 14:28 - Marco: Yeah 25 thousands covers the entire cost of the laptop 25 times lol
12/29/18, 14:33 - Lorenzo: Hmmm
12/29/18, 14:33 - Lorenzo: I'm still waiting

12/29/18, 14:35 - Lorenzo: I don't think that will make a difference
12/29/18, 14:35 - Marco: Okok good

5/3/19, 11:51 - Lorenzo: Think I'm still sick 😂
5/3/19, 11:52 - Marco: Hahahah motivational is better than demotivated
5/3/19, 11:53 - Lorenzo: True
5/3/19, 11:55 - Lorenzo: But I'm a bit too cynical/sarcastic for these kind of motivational speeches with piano / violin footage running in the background
5/3/19, 11:55 - Lorenzo: As you see on Facebook and YouTube xd
5/3/19, 11:59 - Marco: Hahahah cmon

5/3/19, 17:31 - Marco: Yesss no worries
5/3/19, 17:32 - Marco: The only thing we care about is the feedback, not who gave it
5/3/19, 21:52 - Lorenzo: it's becoming a to be continued story

5/3/19, 22:13 - Marco: I still really don't know how many but if it's a long feedback I guess it's quite some stuff
5/3/19, 22:14 - Lorenzo: Due to the fact that slacking off is our class' signature move
5/3/19, 22:15 - Lorenzo: Well it's not a long one
5/3/19, 22:15 - Lorenzo: Just wanted to be sure I put everything in it
5/3/19, 22:15 - Marco: Ja
5/3/19, 22:15 - Marco: Greatt
5/4/19, 17:14 - Lorenzo: Also

5/4/19, 17:15 - Lorenzo: I really wonder how that will work
5/4/19, 18:47 - Marco: <Media omitted>

5/6/19, 19:26 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
5/6/19, 19:28 - Marco: Yeah I can understand, also because you put much more effort than me during the rest of the year so the same solution doesnt necessarily relate to you

5/15/19, 21:50 - Marco: Ok good
5/15/19, 21:51 - Lorenzo: why would you present a previous presentation
5/15/19, 21:51 - Marco: And do you think the presentation of the process should be as visual as the first one
5/15/19, 21:51 - Marco: Idk I think the research is interesting
5/15/19, 21:51 - Marco: But paradoxically I found out that I can connect concepts better with words
5/15/19, 21:51 - Marco: Like
5/15/19, 21:52 - Marco: To make my ideas clear on a paper
5/15/19, 21:52 - Marco: I don't know if that's a good thing in an art school haha
5/15/19, 21:52 - Lorenzo: tbh my brain starts yawning at the moment
5/15/19, 21:52 - Marco: But for now I'm finding that more helpful in getting ahead with a concept
5/15/19, 21:52 - Lorenzo: I'll try to read it again

5/22/19, 22:50 - Lorenzo: well
5/22/19, 22:50 - Lorenzo: not sure about that
5/22/19, 22:51 - Marco: Idk it gives more of a raw feeling
5/22/19, 22:51 - Marco: But also depends on what you want to tplay
5/22/19, 22:51 - Lorenzo: hahah true about that
5/22/19, 22:51 - Marco: At the end you should've said "smash like and subscribe"
5/22/19, 22:51 - Lorenzo: no
5/22/19, 22:52 - Lorenzo: fuck that hahahahaha
5/22/19, 22:52 - Lorenzo: I'd kill for a good amplifier
5/22/19, 22:52 - Marco: I'd kill for a guitar haha
5/22/19, 22:52 - Lorenzo: I miss playing loud hahaha
5/22/19, 22:52 - Marco: You dont have a good one?

*white noise*
5/22/19, 22:59 - Marco: I don't think it's something difficult to solve at all
5/22/19, 22:59 - Marco: But I might be mistaken
5/22/19, 22:59 - Lorenzo: it's at my parents' place
5/22/19, 23:00 - Marco: Oh then that's why
5/22/19, 23:00 - Lorenzo: but I've been too lazy to bring it to an amplifier repair
5/22/19, 23:01 - Lorenzo: if it doesn't work, I'll go on marktplaats
5/22/19, 23:02 - Lorenzo: haha
5/22/19, 23:03 - Lorenzo: Are you voting tomorrow?
5/22/19, 23:05 - Marco: I'm thinking about buying a guitar from there
5/22/19, 23:05 - Marco: You think it's a good idea
5/22/19, 23:05 - Marco: No, really didn't have any mindspace for politics lately
5/22/19, 23:05 - Lorenzo: depends
5/22/19, 23:05 - Lorenzo: ah okay
5/22/19, 23:05 - Lorenzo: yeah I'm currently checking debates
5/22/19, 23:05 - Marco: You
5/22/19, 23:05 - Lorenzo: yeah
5/22/19, 23:05 - Lorenzo: I think it's important
5/22/19, 23:05 - Marco: On
5/22/19, 23:06 - Lorenzo: well, specifics, quality
5/22/19, 23:06 - Lorenzo: I mean you would prolly buy a starter guitar right?
5/22/19, 23:06 - Marco: Yeah cause that's what I am
5/22/19, 23:06 - Marco: A starter
5/22/19, 23:06 - Marco: :(
5/22/19, 23:06 - Marco: No yeah btw
5/22/19, 23:07 - Marco: But as good as I can get it
5/22/19, 23:07 - Marco: For like 60 euros
5/22/19, 23:07 - Marco: I probably can just get a crappy one
5/22/19, 23:07 - Lorenzo: going for acotustic?
5/22/19, 23:07 - Lorenzo: acoustic*
5/22/19, 23:07 - Marco: I think so, it's easier for me
5/22/19, 23:07 - Lorenzo: ifso, spanish or western
5/22/19, 23:07 - Marco: You think I should be going for classic
5/22/19, 23:07 - Marco: Western
5/22/19, 23:07 - Lorenzo: classic is spanish :P
5/22/19, 23:08 - Marco: Hahaha spanish culture is something I really can't stand that much
5/22/19, 23:08 - Lorenzo: wow
5/22/19, 23:08 - Marco: And sounds and most things about spain
5/22/19, 23:08 - Marco: Just don't vibe with it
5/22/19, 23:08 - Marco: So if the sound really recalls that kind of thing
5/22/19, 23:09 - Marco: I won't go for that
5/22/19, 23:09 - Lorenzo: hm yeah dunno, I really so classical spanish guitar
5/22/19, 23:09 - Lorenzo: or like related
5/22/19, 23:09 - Lorenzo: for instance flamenco
5/22/19, 23:09 - Marco: Neee not my stuff
5/22/19, 23:09 - Lorenzo: dunno
5/22/19, 23:09 - Lorenzo: it's just a part of what I like about it
5/22/19, 23:10 - Lorenzo: because it's also an important heritage for guitar
5/22/19, 23:10 - Lorenzo: besides
5/22/19, 23:10 - Lorenzo: I always hated wonderwall
5/22/19, 23:11 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
5/22/19, 23:11 - Lorenzo: my stack
5/22/19, 23:11 - Marco: Oh finally
5/22/19, 23:11 - Marco: Someone says it
5/22/19, 23:11 - Marco: Damnnn
5/22/19, 23:11 - Marco: I dunno maybe I have to research on it
5/22/19, 23:11 - Lorenzo: ofcourse
5/22/19, 23:11 - Lorenzo: important
5/22/19, 23:12 - Marco: But so spanish and western are two types of acoustic
5/22/19, 23:12 - Lorenzo: yes I mean
5/22/19, 23:12 - Marco: Ok
5/22/19, 23:12 - Lorenzo: western is more likely to be used for 
country
Folk 
blues
bluegrass
5/22/19, 23:12 - Marco: And starting with acoustic or classic doesnt matter, or do you recommend either one
5/22/19, 23:12 - Marco: Eh blues
5/22/19, 23:12 - Lorenzo: also
5/22/19, 23:12 - Lorenzo: western has steel strings
5/22/19, 23:13 - Marco: Yeah I know
5/22/19, 23:13 - Lorenzo: and spanish has nylon
5/22/19, 23:13 - Marco: I tried both
5/22/19, 23:13 - Marco: And classic was so difficult for me
5/22/19, 23:13 - Marco: Painful to play at some point
5/22/19, 23:13 - Lorenzo: aaaand ehm
5/22/19, 23:13 - Lorenzo: haha this debate is a good lullaby
5/22/19, 23:13 - Marco: Hahahah
5/22/19, 23:13 - Marco: I will also do my research
5/22/19, 23:14 - Marco: But last question, what decent brand do you think I can find for that price range
5/22/19, 23:14 - Marco: I think eko
5/22/19, 23:14 - Marco: Probably ibanez, no?
5/22/19, 23:14 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
5/22/19, 23:14 - Lorenzo: fuckin right wing
5/22/19, 23:14 - Lorenzo: elitist cunts
5/22/19, 23:14 - Lorenzo: anyway
5/22/19, 23:14 - Marco: Who of the two
5/22/19, 23:15 - Lorenzo: the image is thierry baudet
5/22/19, 23:15 - Lorenzo: eeehma
5/22/19, 23:15 - Lorenzo: well dunno
5/22/19, 23:15 - Lorenzo: if you have a link I could check it out
5/22/19, 23:17 - Marco: Okk I will search tomorrow
5/22/19, 23:18 - Marco: Yeah I know, I read "elitist cunt' and I wasn't sure about who of the two you were referring two
5/22/19, 23:18 - Marco: Then I read again
5/22/19, 23:18 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
5/22/19, 23:19 - Lorenzo: it's like watching a circus of rightwing
5/22/19, 23:19 - Lorenzo: kinda amusing
5/22/19, 23:20 - Lorenzo: it's also because the liberal party (vvd) is the leading party 
and the forum for democracy (fvd)  is the party with the most votes in the netherlands in the recent elections
5/22/19, 23:21 - Marco: I feel you
5/22/19, 23:22 - Lorenzo: I will probably vote for the partij voor de dieren -> party for the animal rights, they're part of this movemnt:
5/22/19, 23:22 - Lorenzo: https://www.guengl.eu/
5/22/19, 23:23 - Lorenzo: it's like a left-wing not necessarily against europe but for a different europe
5/22/19, 23:23 - Marco: Oh but you didnt mean european elections
5/22/19, 23:23 - Marco: Or did you
5/22/19, 23:24 - Lorenzo: I did
5/22/19, 23:24 - Marco: Oh om
5/22/19, 23:24 - Marco: Ok*
5/22/19, 23:24 - Marco: What about the groenen, are they a good party here
5/22/19, 23:24 - Lorenzo: but I vote for a dutch delegation which are part of a bigger concern who will be divided along others in the eeu
5/22/19, 23:24 - Marco: Yeah like the groenen
5/22/19, 23:25 - Marco: Cause they have them in almost every country I thibk
5/22/19, 23:25 - Lorenzo: I heard about them
5/22/19, 23:26 - Lorenzo: hahahaha
5/22/19, 23:26 - Marco: Hahahah
5/22/19, 23:26 - Lorenzo: they're the only one
5/22/19, 23:26 - Marco: I thought at least in the netherlands they would be a bit more relevant
5/22/19, 23:26 - Lorenzo: that are pro-basic income
5/22/19, 23:26 - Lorenzo: but the funny thing is
5/22/19, 23:27 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
5/22/19, 23:28 - Lorenzo: well the thing is
5/22/19, 23:28 - Lorenzo: partij voor dieren and groenlinks
5/22/19, 23:28 - Lorenzo: de diereN*
5/22/19, 23:28 - Lorenzo: are more relevant here I guess
5/22/19, 23:29 - Lorenzo: I don't like groenlinks
5/22/19, 23:29 - Lorenzo: before the 'partij voor de dieren' I voted for the socialist party
5/22/19, 23:29 - Marco: Are they a good party here
5/22/19, 23:30 - Lorenzo: which one
5/22/19, 23:30 - Lorenzo: the socialist?
5/22/19, 23:31 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
5/22/19, 23:32 - Lorenzo: they're only locally active
5/22/19, 23:32 - Lorenzo: the groenen, that is
5/22/19, 23:33 - Lorenzo: well, the socialist party is ok I guess
5/22/19, 23:33 - Lorenzo: bit too much anti-europe in this case
5/22/19, 23:34 - Marco: In italy it almost doesnt exist
5/22/19, 23:36 - Lorenzo: damn
5/22/19, 23:36 - Lorenzo: I'm shutting down haha
5/22/19, 23:36 - Lorenzo: I'm getting a headache

6/7/19, 21:29 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
6/7/19, 21:32 - Marco: Yeah but the upload protocols they use are not from google so it really depends on how good is the work that the browser developers do
6/7/19, 21:32 - Marco: And firefox's developers are way better
6/7/19, 21:32 - Lorenzo: agreed
6/7/19, 21:33 - Lorenzo: is it a bad thing if chill a bit tonight?
6/7/19, 21:33 - Marco: Not at all

8/5/19, 23:30 - Lorenzo: thing was

8/5/19, 23:31 - Marco: Love the football illustratie
8/5/19, 23:31 - Lorenzo: but I didn't know she would bring the three other people  (black woman, black hagrid (hahahaha) and the young rasta, those are vocalists who I know from street dub and featurings on Dub Dynasty / Alpha & Omega albums)
8/5/19, 23:32 - Lorenzo: so when they were suddenly in the center I was like WHAAAAAT *screams like a little girl hahahaha
8/5/19, 23:32 - Marco: Ahahahah
8/5/19, 23:32 - Marco: It's nice that the concert is in the center
8/5/19, 23:32 - Marco: Never seen that before
8/5/19, 23:32 - Marco: That's amazing
8/5/19, 23:32 - Lorenzo: well yeah ehm
8/5/19, 23:33 - Lorenzo: it's either like dj or I mean Selectors in a tent somewhere to the side
8/5/19, 23:33 - Lorenzo: or King Shiloh Soundsystem in the center of the party
8/5/19, 23:33 - Marco: That's a nice concept
8/5/19, 23:34 - Marco: All the concerts should be like this
8/5/19, 23:34 - Lorenzo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxFVSkBwvOY
8/5/19, 23:34 - Marco: With bands mainly
8/5/19, 23:35 - Lorenzo: ye well this is at reggae geel
8/5/19, 23:35 - Lorenzo: there are stages
8/5/19, 23:35 - Lorenzo: but this is the infamous 18" corner
8/5/19, 23:36 - Marco: I wanna join if you go to another one
8/5/19, 23:36 - Marco: If you dont mind
8/5/19, 23:36 - Lorenzo: strictly sound system and dub on friday 18:00 - 03:00 and saturday 12:00 - 04:00
8/5/19, 23:36 - Lorenzo: well not sure if I'm going to another reggae festival
8/5/19, 23:37 - Lorenzo: but if there is Dub somewhere I'll try to remember to tell you haha
8/5/19, 23:37 - Marco: Okk
8/5/19, 23:37 - Lorenzo: So yeah some info: I went to reggae geel first time in 2013 and I didn't know the concept of dub
8/5/19, 23:38 - Lorenzo: but in december 2013 there was the first King Shiloh gig in Rotterdam
8/5/19, 23:45 - Lorenzo: (they are older than this)
8/5/19, 23:46 - Lorenzo: but it was my first dubnight and also the first time I started wearing ear protection
8/5/19, 23:46 - Lorenzo: which was ironic since I already went to dnb parties alot
8/5/19, 23:46 - Lorenzo: but soundsystems are different than plain speakers at a club
8/5/19, 23:47 - Lorenzo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EfJFhXV26w
8/5/19, 23:50 - Lorenzo: Note: I'm not any form of rastafari, I just like reggae / dub / ska / rocksteady / oldschool dancehall haha
8/5/19, 23:56 - Marco: I would also know nothing
8/5/19, 23:56 - Marco: If I went to one
8/5/19, 23:57 - Lorenzo: haha yeah the thing is it just grabbed me
8/5/19, 23:57 - Lorenzo: and I was like OKAY THIS IS NICE
8/6/19, 00:04 - Marco: I imagine
8/6/19, 00:06 - Lorenzo: btw
8/6/19, 00:06 - Lorenzo: I had a shocking moment today
8/6/19, 00:06 - Lorenzo: Jilbert went to some congress
8/6/19, 00:06 - Marco: Hahahah yeah
8/6/19, 00:06 - Marco: Don't forget to mention international
8/6/19, 00:06 - Lorenzo: yes but above that
8/6/19, 00:07 - Lorenzo: and suddenly I saw that it was a congress for *JEHOVA'S WITNESSES*
8/6/19, 00:09 - Marco: Hahahaah reallyyy
8/6/19, 00:09 - Marco: Wtff
8/6/19, 00:12 - Marco: Can you recommend me a film
8/6/19, 00:17 - Lorenzo: What kind of film
8/6/19, 00:24 - Marco: Not comedy
8/6/19, 00:24 - Marco: Something serious
8/6/19, 00:24 - Marco: That gives ispirations
8/6/19, 00:25 - Marco: Like nice visuals and stuff
8/6/19, 00:25 - Lorenzo: Ehm
8/6/19, 00:26 - Lorenzo: Under the skin
8/6/19, 00:26 - Marco: Sounds nice
8/6/19, 00:26 - Marco: Is it horror
8/6/19, 00:26 - Lorenzo: The fountain
8/6/19, 00:26 - Lorenzo: Kind of
8/6/19, 00:27 - Marco: The fountain is from aronofsky(?)
8/6/19, 00:27 - Marco: What about the fountain
8/6/19, 00:27 - Lorenzo: Hell yea
8/6/19, 00:27 - Marco: Ok i didnt watch it yet
8/6/19, 00:27 - Lorenzo: Noooooo horror
8/6/19, 00:27 - Marco: So that is for reminding me that it exists haha
8/6/19, 00:27 - Lorenzo: It has deeper meaning
8/6/19, 10:01 - Marco: It was nice but also mind blowing haha
8/6/19, 10:02 - Lorenzo: Which one
8/6/19, 10:02 - Lorenzo: Fountain?
8/6/19, 10:32 - Marco: Ja
8/6/19, 10:32 - Marco: The scene where plants grow out of the guy
8/6/19, 10:32 - Marco: Disturbing
8/6/19, 10:32 - Marco: It was a good film but I'm not sure I caught all the meanings tbh
8/6/19, 10:46 - Lorenzo: I get it
8/6/19, 10:47 - Lorenzo: Dunno the quotes really got to me
8/6/19, 10:49 - Lorenzo: _Every shadow no matter how deep is threatened by morning light._

_Our bodies are prisons for our souls. Our skin and blood, the iron bars of confinement. But fear not. All flesh decays. Death turns all to ash. And thus, death frees every soul._
8/6/19, 10:50 - Lorenzo: Why do you find it disturbing?
8/6/19, 11:26 - Marco: No I kind of got the general meaning and some specific things too
8/6/19, 11:26 - Marco: But I feel like I've left something behind for sure
8/6/19, 11:26 - Marco: Idk I've never actually seen that
8/6/19, 11:27 - Lorenzo: if one thing is for sure, it's that it portraits a very spiritual journey through three timelines
8/6/19, 11:27 - Marco: And it's quite disturbing to me having something growing in and out of your body at a great pace while you're alive and aware and have no control over it
8/6/19, 11:27 - Marco: Yeah, and I'm not sure I fully understood the connection between them
8/6/19, 11:28 - Marco: Or I mean
8/6/19, 11:28 - Marco: I do, but I'm not sure if there is some more to it that I didn't see
8/6/19, 11:28 - Lorenzo: it's been a while since I have seen the movie but I thought they were all the same
8/6/19, 11:28 - Marco: Yeah actually
8/6/19, 11:30 - Lorenzo: I like how spirituality is practised in the movie
8/6/19, 11:31 - Lorenzo: instead of being awake = being positive = being enlightened, how meditation is often perceived and promoted..
8/6/19, 11:32 - Lorenzo: they show the element of suffering really well I think
8/6/19, 11:32 - Lorenzo: also when I saw Interstellar, it made me think of this movie
8/6/19, 11:50 - Marco: Yeah it kind of connects
8/6/19, 11:51 - Lorenzo: pfoe
8/6/19, 11:51 - Lorenzo: which means oof in Dutch
8/6/19, 11:52 - Lorenzo: lack of dopamine and overly tired hahaha, post party depression

8/22/19, 15:23 - Marco: I do it cause I like how dynamic the shapes are with a quick line
8/22/19, 15:23 - Lorenzo: You mean that you see movement?

8/29/19, 18:44 - Marco: It was closed, whyyyyyy
8/29/19, 18:45 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
8/29/19, 18:46 - Marco: Exactly
8/29/19, 18:50 - Marco: Sounds fucking great

8/29/19, 18:51 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
8/29/19, 18:52 - Lorenzo: This is the same song
8/29/19, 18:52 - Lorenzo: If you don't recognize it I'll share the song
8/29/19, 18:52 - Marco: Not really, let me hear it again
8/29/19, 18:53 - Lorenzo: This one

8/29/19, 18:54 - Lorenzo: https://youtu.be/u7K72X4eo_s
8/29/19, 18:55 - Marco: I knew the song but not the title and who made it

8/30/19, 22:23 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
8/30/19, 23:17 - Marco: Yeah I'm also looking forward to that, hoping that it doesn't end up like with Eva
8/30/19, 23:18 - Lorenzo: lol yeah
8/30/19, 23:18 - Lorenzo: What was she going to do anyway
8/30/19, 23:18 - Lorenzo: of is she
8/30/19, 23:19 - Lorenzo: or *
8/30/19, 23:19 - Marco: Idk but I don't think the class was very welcoming with her
8/30/19, 23:19 - Marco: Including me
8/30/19, 23:19 - Marco: We treated her a bit like the new kid in elementary school I feeli like
8/30/19, 23:19 - Lorenzo: what do you mean
8/30/19, 23:19 - Marco: Feel like
8/30/19, 23:19 - Marco: No one showed themselves half as enthusiast to have her in class
8/30/19, 23:21 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
8/30/19, 23:24 - Lorenzo: I mean by strange
8/30/19, 23:24 - Lorenzo: that there's like a forced thing
8/30/19, 23:24 - Marco: 100% truth
8/30/19, 23:24 - Lorenzo: Birthday wise
8/30/19, 23:24 - Marco: How can you stand that
8/30/19, 23:25 - Marco: Like the forced kind of attitude sometimes
8/30/19, 23:25 - Marco: I really really really hate that
8/30/19, 23:25 - Marco: In everyone
8/30/19, 23:25 - Lorenzo: like the birthday is the perfect example about
8/30/19, 23:25 - Marco: Not only our class
8/30/19, 23:25 - Lorenzo: how people are
8/30/19, 23:25 - Marco: Everyone in my life
8/30/19, 23:25 - Marco: Really how do you cope w that
8/30/19, 23:25 - Marco: Because I can't
8/30/19, 23:25 - Lorenzo: what do you mean
8/30/19, 23:26 - Lorenzo: the fake happiness forced
8/30/19, 23:26 - Lorenzo: around your cheeks?
8/30/19, 23:26 - Marco: That many things and behaviours in our class are forced
8/30/19, 23:26 - Marco: Yeah
8/30/19, 23:26 - Lorenzo: yes
8/30/19, 23:26 - Marco: The birthdays is only one example
8/30/19, 23:26 - Marco: Big example
8/30/19, 23:26 - Lorenzo: Yes
8/30/19, 23:26 - Marco: But yeah thay
8/30/19, 23:26 - Marco: That
8/30/19, 23:26 - Lorenzo: you know it's kinda shitty
8/30/19, 23:26 - Marco: I really don't know how to deal with ir
8/30/19, 23:26 - Marco: It
8/30/19, 23:27 - Marco: Never had that back in italy
8/30/19, 23:27 - Lorenzo: I mean, when it was other peoples bday
8/30/19, 23:27 - Lorenzo: people got gifts (which people didn't even want gifts for)
8/30/19, 23:27 - Lorenzo: and then it was my bday
8/30/19, 23:27 - Lorenzo: and nobody
8/30/19, 23:28 - Marco: Yeah it was something at the start but then it faded away
8/30/19, 23:28 - Marco: Yeah my bday too
8/30/19, 23:28 - Lorenzo: I repeat nobody gave something less then a congratz or like handshake
8/30/19, 23:28 - Marco: Because people realized how blatantly forced it is
8/30/19, 23:28 - Marco: I know but are you fine with that?
8/30/19, 23:28 - Lorenzo: Well or some hugs by the nicer people
8/30/19, 23:28 - Lorenzo: well usually yes
8/30/19, 23:29 - Lorenzo: but if you integrate a system and halfway fuck it up
8/30/19, 23:29 - Marco: Hahaha yeah it's messed up
8/30/19, 23:29 - Marco: Echt fucktup
8/30/19, 23:29 - Lorenzo: (Which I really predicted if you read it back)
8/30/19, 23:29 - Marco: Ahahah yeah me too
8/30/19, 23:29 - Marco: I asked myself since the start
8/30/19, 23:30 - Marco: "Are they really gonna do this for everyone until the fucking last day of the year?"
8/30/19, 23:30 - Lorenzo: and that's also what I don't like about Jeroen bc he was one of the people who asked it
8/30/19, 23:30 - Marco: And I knew the answer already
8/30/19, 23:30 - Lorenzo: not to talk shit about Jeroen
8/30/19, 23:30 - Marco: Yeah but I think his intention was kind of pure
8/30/19, 23:30 - Lorenzo: exactly
8/30/19, 23:30 - Marco: You can I don't mind
8/30/19, 23:30 - Lorenzo: also you know the tunnel thing
8/30/19, 23:30 - Marco: Yeah
8/30/19, 23:31 - Lorenzo: when he talked about he was in a depression
8/30/19, 23:31 - Marco: The tunnel bs
8/30/19, 23:31 - Marco: Yeah I hated that project
8/30/19, 23:31 - Lorenzo: then he looked with the puppy eyes
8/30/19, 23:31 - Marco: From the presentation to the end
8/30/19, 23:31 - Lorenzo: wittwe jewoen was sadiewadie
8/30/19, 23:31 - Lorenzo: pout pout
8/30/19, 23:31 - Marco: Puppy eyes is an accurate description hahaha
8/30/19, 23:31 - Lorenzo: yes
8/30/19, 23:31 - Marco: It instantly gave me an accurate image of that moment
8/30/19, 23:31 - Marco: That I had buried
8/30/19, 23:31 - Marco: Deep
8/30/19, 23:32 - Lorenzo: he's like the nice guys in a 90s high school series
8/30/19, 23:32 - Marco: Hahahaha
8/30/19, 23:32 - Marco: But no I like jeroen
8/30/19, 23:32 - Lorenzo: who you like but kinda find annoying sometimes :P
8/30/19, 23:32 - Marco: He may be saying a lot of bs but he is truly positive (not always truly but more than many others) and has very good qualities that I appreciatw
8/30/19, 23:33 - Lorenzo: Yes
8/30/19, 23:33 - Lorenzo: I agree
8/30/19, 23:33 - Marco: Uhm
8/30/19, 23:33 - Marco: I find everyone kind of annoying sometimes, but not only class
8/30/19, 23:33 - Marco: Like everyone
8/30/19, 23:33 - Lorenzo: true
8/30/19, 23:33 - Marco: Absolute
8/30/19, 23:33 - Lorenzo: ofc
8/30/19, 23:33 - Lorenzo: tell you
8/30/19, 23:33 - Lorenzo: what
8/30/19, 23:33 - Marco: But really maybee
8/30/19, 23:33 - Marco: Idk
8/30/19, 23:34 - Lorenzo: I once said that I admire him in his positive attitude
8/30/19, 23:34 - Marco: There is really no one in that class that really makes me fucking annoyed
8/30/19, 23:34 - Lorenzo: and like keeping the flow
8/30/19, 23:34 - Marco: There used to be
8/30/19, 23:34 - Marco: But now idc anymore
8/30/19, 23:34 - Lorenzo: true
8/30/19, 23:34 - Lorenzo: but I'm now just projecting
8/30/19, 23:34 - Marco: During this summer I've learned to not let people affect me too much negatively
8/30/19, 23:34 - Lorenzo: because I'm not in a positive mood myself :p
8/30/19, 23:35 - Marco: I can relate
8/30/19, 23:35 - Lorenzo: well there are some exams coming up for that matter hahaha
8/30/19, 23:35 - Marco: Which is why I can't really answer your question
8/30/19, 23:35 - Marco: Wdym
8/30/19, 23:35 - Lorenzo: question?
8/30/19, 23:35 - Marco: Yeah
8/30/19, 23:35 - Lorenzo: I was still finishing that sentence
8/30/19, 23:36 - Marco: :P
8/30/19, 23:36 - Lorenzo: oooohhh
8/30/19, 23:36 - Marco: This question
8/30/19, 23:36 - Lorenzo: That wasn't a question
8/30/19, 23:36 - Lorenzo: that was adding to the nice guys
8/30/19, 23:36 - Marco: Oh
8/30/19, 23:36 - Marco: Hahahah
8/30/19, 23:36 - Marco: Soz
8/30/19, 23:36 - Lorenzo: is oke hoor
8/30/19, 23:36 - Marco: What does echt mean btw
8/30/19, 23:37 - Lorenzo: real / really
8/30/19, 23:37 - Marco: I'm hearing it all the time
8/30/19, 23:37 - Marco: Jesus fuck haha
8/30/19, 23:37 - Marco: I may have heard it 100 times in the past week
8/30/19, 23:37 - Lorenzo: echt?
8/30/19, 23:37 - Marco: Yeah
8/30/19, 23:37 - Lorenzo: wauw
8/30/19, 23:37 - Marco: But anyway
8/30/19, 23:37 - Marco: Going back to that topic
8/30/19, 23:38 - Lorenzo: I'm partly misanthrope hahaha
8/30/19, 23:38 - Marco: You're gonna see many differences on who I will be with and how I will interact with people this year
8/30/19, 23:38 - Marco: I hope
8/30/19, 23:38 - Lorenzo: Well don't try to be another person than the one you are
8/30/19, 23:39 - Marco: No that's what I did last year
8/30/19, 23:39 - Marco: Until last year
8/30/19, 23:39 - Lorenzo: _We want to be loved for who we appear to be instead of who we are_ hahaha
8/30/19, 23:39 - Marco: I really morphed my personality to appeal to people who then turned out to be toxic or not worth my attention at all
8/30/19, 23:40 - Marco: And I'm veryvery done with that
8/30/19, 23:40 - Lorenzo: like?
8/30/19, 23:40 - Marco: Cringe
8/30/19, 23:40 - Marco: Like what
8/30/19, 23:40 - Lorenzo: no like who
8/30/19, 23:40 - Lorenzo: or in general you mean
8/30/19, 23:40 - Lorenzo: hey this is a decent song
8/30/19, 23:40 - Lorenzo: wait
8/30/19, 23:40 - Marco: In general but you know who I passed most of my time with
8/30/19, 23:41 - Lorenzo: I'm gonna go with the second letter on your top row on your keyboard
8/30/19, 23:41 - Marco: Ahahahahah
8/30/19, 23:41 - Marco: Not only
8/30/19, 23:41 - Lorenzo: roberto as well? :o
8/30/19, 23:42 - Marco: Imagine that
8/30/19, 23:42 - Lorenzo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iprW6lUiM4
8/30/19, 23:42 - Marco: But with wies I honestly kind of knew since the start that we were not really meant to be friends
8/30/19, 23:42 - Marco: I mean we really think alike many times
8/30/19, 23:42 - Lorenzo: Yeah she needs to discover a lot in that brain of hers
8/30/19, 23:43 - Marco: But I also sometimes changed the way I think to keep up this illusion that we think alike
8/30/19, 23:43 - Marco: And I kind of wanted to challenge myself to be friends with people that are totally out of my comfort zone
8/30/19, 23:43 - Marco: But I went too far
8/30/19, 23:43 - Lorenzo: that is a good thing
8/30/19, 23:43 - Marco: Yeah I know I've learned a lot
8/30/19, 23:44 - Marco: Including that they are not my type of people
8/30/19, 23:44 - Marco: And I'm not their type of people apparently
8/30/19, 23:44 - Lorenzo: yeah well I have that with my inner circle of friends
8/30/19, 23:44 - Lorenzo: I have had some friends from other corners and such
8/30/19, 23:45 - Lorenzo: and at some point I felt that these people aren't ment to be this close to me
8/30/19, 23:45 - Lorenzo: meant*
8/30/19, 23:45 - Lorenzo: but I kept on returning to the same loyal friends
8/30/19, 23:45 - Marco: Yeah I understand
8/30/19, 23:46 - Marco: I didn't even have such meaningful connections back in italy
8/30/19, 23:46 - Marco: So it was really new for me everything
8/30/19, 23:46 - Marco: For you maybe not because you've been here your whole life
8/30/19, 23:46 - Lorenzo: what age are you again?
8/30/19, 23:46 - Marco: 10.847
8/30/19, 23:46 - Marco: 21
8/30/19, 23:46 - Lorenzo: ahja
8/30/19, 23:46 - Lorenzo: well the thing is
8/30/19, 23:47 - Lorenzo: I am a lucky person to have gathered these people
8/30/19, 23:47 - Lorenzo: because a few of them I know from the int0rwebz or school
8/30/19, 23:47 - Marco: Ahahah int0rwebz
8/30/19, 23:47 - Marco: Took a while
8/30/19, 23:47 - Lorenzo: hahaha ja
8/30/19, 23:48 - Marco: Yeah that's cool thay you have that
8/30/19, 23:48 - Marco: But I know I will also find these people
8/30/19, 23:48 - Lorenzo: yeah the thing is
8/30/19, 23:48 - Marco: But this summer I learned to appreciate being alone
8/30/19, 23:48 - Lorenzo: you won't find them
8/30/19, 23:48 - Lorenzo: they'll appear
8/30/19, 23:48 - Lorenzo: at some point
8/30/19, 23:48 - Marco: Like to actually appreciate it
8/30/19, 23:48 - Marco: I know
8/30/19, 23:48 - Lorenzo: and stick to your feet like fungus
8/30/19, 23:48 - Marco: And this is the first step for thay
8/30/19, 23:49 - Marco: I have one person
8/30/19, 23:49 - Marco: This friend of mine from germany you know
8/30/19, 23:49 - Marco: I've been friends with her for 7 years now
8/30/19, 23:49 - Lorenzo: I read popcorn for some reason hahahaha
8/30/19, 23:49 - Marco: Nothing changed
8/30/19, 23:49 - Lorenzo: no?
8/30/19, 23:49 - Marco: Hahah I wish
8/30/19, 23:49 - Marco: There is this friend that I always say that comes from germany here to visit me
8/30/19, 23:49 - Marco: Hahah
8/30/19, 23:49 - Lorenzo: ohhhh
8/30/19, 23:49 - Lorenzo: yea
8/30/19, 23:50 - Marco: She's been my best friend for years and I didn't look for her
8/30/19, 23:50 - Lorenzo: exactly
8/30/19, 23:50 - Marco: She just texted me out of chance for a math thing or something
8/30/19, 23:50 - Lorenzo: *_FRIENDS_* 
THEY'RE THE GOOD KIND OF RODENT
8/30/19, 23:51 - Marco: I know it's like thay but it's also very difficult for people to appreciate being with you if you don't like being on your own
8/30/19, 23:51 - Marco: That's very stereotypical but true
8/30/19, 23:51 - Lorenzo: wait I need to read that again
8/30/19, 23:51 - Marco: Ahahah I didn't get it but it made me laugh
8/30/19, 23:51 - Marco: Yeah it's not really clear
8/30/19, 23:51 - Marco: Basically it's
8/30/19, 23:51 - Marco: "No one will love you if you don't love yourself"
8/30/19, 23:51 - Lorenzo: *stoner smoking gesture
8/30/19, 23:52 - Marco: Only I wanted to say it in a different way
8/30/19, 23:52 - Lorenzo: Oh yeah
8/30/19, 23:52 - Marco: Cause I hate that everyone says this
8/30/19, 23:52 - Marco: But this summer I started actually having fun on my own for the first time (sounds really equivocal)
8/30/19, 23:52 - Marco: But for real
8/30/19, 23:52 - Marco: I never had that before
8/30/19, 23:53 - Marco: I didn't think you could feel happy alone but you can
8/30/19, 23:53 - Marco: Maybe you can't forever but no one is gonna be alone forever
8/30/19, 23:53 - Marco: Unless they retire in a cave or smth
8/30/19, 23:53 - Lorenzo: well lemme tell you that one of the reasons I'm seeing a psychologist is that I have had what you call an _inferiority complex_  so about loving someone after loving thyself  you are right
8/30/19, 23:54 - Marco: I think I have the same
8/30/19, 23:54 - Marco: But is it working out for you?
8/30/19, 23:54 - Lorenzo: I need to see it still
8/30/19, 23:54 - Marco: Like are you making progress with that
8/30/19, 23:54 - Marco: Ok
8/30/19, 23:54 - Lorenzo: I'm handling it as they say
8/30/19, 23:54 - Lorenzo: but more like coping
8/30/19, 23:54 - Marco: Same but I think I got pretty far in the process
8/30/19, 23:55 - Lorenzo: but I think what helped me in being alone
8/30/19, 23:55 - Lorenzo: is that I got to embrace my darkness
8/30/19, 23:55 - Marco: Accept it
8/30/19, 23:55 - Lorenzo: embracing it
8/30/19, 23:55 - Lorenzo: for it is there always
8/30/19, 23:55 - Marco: Yeah ofc
8/30/19, 23:55 - Lorenzo: accepting is more like
8/30/19, 23:56 - Marco: So you gotta accept that is there and not let it condition your light instead
8/30/19, 23:56 - Lorenzo: *hey here's the contract ok cool welcome*
8/30/19, 23:56 - Marco: Yeah no i don't mean it like thay
8/30/19, 23:56 - Marco: That
8/30/19, 23:56 - Lorenzo: embracing is more like
8/30/19, 23:56 - Marco: Lost in translation you know
8/30/19, 23:56 - Lorenzo: _so you wanna talk? let's talk, here have something to drink_
8/30/19, 23:56 - Marco: Yeah going through it without letting it overwhelm you
8/30/19, 23:57 - Lorenzo: Yeah exactly
8/30/19, 23:57 - Marco: Right on
8/30/19, 23:57 - Lorenzo: I should make an entire house based on these emotions and dealing with them
8/30/19, 23:57 - Marco: I-m very curious on how they will act at school
8/30/19, 23:57 - Marco: Wies and roberto i mean
8/30/19, 23:57 - Lorenzo: haha exactly
8/30/19, 23:57 - Marco: Towards me
8/30/19, 23:57 - Lorenzo: Act
8/30/19, 23:57 - Marco: Yeah like behave
8/30/19, 23:57 - Lorenzo: acting vs being
8/30/19, 23:58 - Marco: Not really different in their case I'm afraid
8/30/19, 23:58 - Marco: But don't wanna talk shit about them
8/30/19, 23:58 - Marco: Very difficult for me but I should control myself on that
8/30/19, 23:58 - Lorenzo: well you may if that is what your soul sings
8/30/19, 23:58 - Marco: _proceeds to put them in bad light to everyone in class_
8/30/19, 23:58 - Lorenzo: well yeah
8/30/19, 23:59 - Marco: It's out of tune when it sings bad things about other people
8/30/19, 23:59 - Lorenzo: no it's in a different tune
8/30/19, 23:59 - Marco: Nah
8/30/19, 23:59 - Marco: I don't think talking shit about them makes me any better
8/30/19, 23:59 - Lorenzo: no
8/30/19, 23:59 - Lorenzo: but talking about them is okay
8/30/19, 23:59 - Lorenzo: And that's a problem imo
8/31/19, 00:00 - Marco: Yeah but if I talk about them now I talk shit about them
8/31/19, 00:00 - Lorenzo: bc if you talk about people, about what concerns you about them
8/31/19, 00:00 - Marco: But later in time maybe
8/31/19, 00:00 - Lorenzo: it's shit talking
8/31/19, 00:00 - Marco: To be honest
8/31/19, 00:00 - Lorenzo: it's not like oh they suck donkey balls
8/31/19, 00:00 - Lorenzo: it isn't**
8/31/19, 00:00 - Marco: I will gladly wait for the satisfaction of everyone realizing with their own eyes the true people they are
8/31/19, 00:01 - Marco: And if that doesn't happen so be it
8/31/19, 00:01 - Lorenzo: I mean I like everyone in class
8/31/19, 00:01 - Marco: If it happens then maybe everyone will make them notice and they will realize that they have to change something in themselves
8/31/19, 00:01 - Lorenzo: and can get by with almost everyone
8/31/19, 00:01 - Lorenzo: doesn't mean I don't have an opinion to discuss sometimes
8/31/19, 00:01 - Marco: Me too
8/31/19, 00:01 - Lorenzo: because everyone has that
8/31/19, 00:02 - Marco: But apparently that's not the case in the other way round
8/31/19, 00:02 - Lorenzo: I mean everyone has pros and cons
8/31/19, 00:02 - Marco: Sure
8/31/19, 00:03 - Lorenzo: let's just agree on the fact that it's good that Weronika is following her dreams elsewhere
8/31/19, 00:03 - Marco: Hahahajajaha
8/31/19, 00:03 - Marco: Jeezus
8/31/19, 00:03 - Marco: Hahahah
8/31/19, 00:03 - Lorenzo: the thing is
8/31/19, 00:03 - Marco: Why you didnt like her
8/31/19, 00:03 - Marco: Ok you're not very compatinle
8/31/19, 00:03 - Marco: Ble
8/31/19, 00:03 - Marco: For sure
8/31/19, 00:03 - Marco: But she was like an extremist version of jeroen
8/31/19, 00:04 - Marco: And I mean extremist
8/31/19, 00:04 - Marco: Like al qaeda shit
8/31/19, 00:04 - Marco: Fuckin Hezbollah
8/31/19, 00:04 - Lorenzo: well she isn't a bad person
8/31/19, 00:04 - Lorenzo: nobody is in their core
8/31/19, 00:04 - Marco: But she had 50% of the energy of the whole class
8/31/19, 00:05 - Lorenzo: Well yeah but I really felt that she had some disrespect or something
8/31/19, 00:05 - Lorenzo: for instance, remember renske's assignment
8/31/19, 00:05 - Lorenzo: the partnering up one
8/31/19, 00:05 - Marco: Well I don't know no respectful terrorists
8/31/19, 00:05 - Marco: Yeah but also electronics with pedro
8/31/19, 00:05 - Lorenzo: yeah
8/31/19, 00:06 - Lorenzo: well
8/31/19, 00:06 - Marco: Very peculiar moment of our class's history
8/31/19, 00:06 - Lorenzo: yeah
8/31/19, 00:06 - Lorenzo: well
8/31/19, 00:06 - Lorenzo: yeah
8/31/19, 00:06 - Marco: Yeah well
8/31/19, 00:06 - Lorenzo: exactly
8/31/19, 00:06 - Marco: She had so much energy she failed to contain it
8/31/19, 00:06 - Marco: And sometimes burned other people with it
8/31/19, 00:06 - Marco: Very badly worded but makes sense in my head
8/31/19, 00:07 - Lorenzo: She really didn't say shit while brainstorming yet expected me to say everything
8/31/19, 00:07 - Lorenzo: she forced that shit to the very last moment
8/31/19, 00:07 - Lorenzo: she literally overdone herself
8/31/19, 00:08 - Lorenzo: I never vibed with her
8/31/19, 00:08 - Lorenzo: sometimes it was nice to talk to her
8/31/19, 00:08 - Lorenzo: but Idk there was something that I didn't feel
8/31/19, 00:09 - Lorenzo: yeah and the thing I dislike about the energy thing
8/31/19, 00:09 - Lorenzo: is that it's forced and not flowing
8/31/19, 00:09 - Lorenzo: or was for that matter
8/31/19, 00:10 - Marco: Yeah she really had a problem controlling her energy
8/31/19, 00:10 - Marco: For me it was fun cause for the first time I wasnt the most anxious in the group
8/31/19, 00:11 - Marco: For the first time I saw myself telling someone else to calm down and that it wasnt that bad
8/31/19, 00:11 - Marco: But ok
8/31/19, 00:11 - Marco: This joint is waiting for me
8/31/19, 00:11 - Marco: Very curious on how the class dynamics will be from next week on
8/31/19, 00:12 - Marco: You deleted this message

8/31/19, 00:16 - Marco: I would also do that if I didnt expect to be seen
8/31/19, 00:16 - Marco: But in that moment it was funny regardless of johan seeing you
8/31/19, 00:16 - Marco: He was just the cherry on the top
8/31/19, 00:16 - Marco: Which his head resembles very much

9/7/19, 23:15 - Lorenzo: well I'm not sure
9/7/19, 23:15 - Marco: I believe there is a difference between hip hop and rap
9/7/19, 23:15 - Lorenzo: yeah wait
9/7/19, 23:15 - Marco: That they are very intertwined but not the same thing
9/7/19, 23:15 - Marco: And this is rap
9/7/19, 23:15 - Lorenzo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jly6bXYGyFk
9/7/19, 23:17 - Marco: Hahaha what's up with this video
9/7/19, 23:17 - Marco: Adobe flash
9/7/19, 23:17 - Lorenzo: respect the architect right
9/7/19, 23:17 - Marco: But what's the point you wanna put across with this song
9/7/19, 23:20 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
9/7/19, 23:20 - Lorenzo: my point is that hip hop is close to punk music
9/7/19, 23:20 - Lorenzo: they're both wisdom from the street that derived from a certain poverty
9/7/19, 23:22 - Lorenzo: the thing is the distant relatives kinda come together at festivals like woohah
9/7/19, 23:22 - Lorenzo: where IMO 20% is actual hiphop
9/7/19, 23:22 - Lorenzo: and 80% distressed high af millennials
9/7/19, 23:23 - Lorenzo: and rap seems more like the attitude as hiphop is the lifestyle I think
9/7/19, 23:24 - Lorenzo: but also my point was that having an open mind towards your genre can lead to great stuff instead of barriers
9/7/19, 23:25 - Lorenzo: would you consider death grips / ho99o9 as hiphop / rap?
9/7/19, 23:30 - Lorenzo: I also think it's strange to read skepta as such a big name since I know him as a grime artist haha
9/8/19, 10:27 - Marco: Yeah I didn't mean to create any, but we were talking about drake and how drake is not hip hop
9/8/19, 10:27 - Marco: He is very influenced by rap for sure
9/8/19, 10:27 - Marco: But he really has kind of his own genre i feel like
9/8/19, 10:27 - Lorenzo: I get what you mean
9/8/19, 10:28 - Marco: When you hear a song from drake you understand it's from drake without necessarily knowing it
9/8/19, 10:28 - Lorenzo: I don't like his appearance and all
9/8/19, 10:28 - Marco: And it's very remarkable considering that his songs can be very different from one another
9/8/19, 10:28 - Lorenzo: yeah but that's because it became generic as well imo
9/8/19, 10:28 - Marco: And he really pushes the boundaries of this pop/rap genre like no other mainstream artist does i feel like
9/8/19, 10:29 - Marco: I dont vibe with it but i gotta admit he has more of a charisma in a way
9/8/19, 10:29 - Marco: He always looks like the guy that knows what he's doing
9/8/19, 10:29 - Marco: And he does
9/8/19, 10:30 - Marco: From a producer standpoint, his music is on a really high level compares to most of the rest of the genre today
9/8/19, 10:30 - Lorenzo: yeah I agree about the fact that his music isn't bad or anything
9/8/19, 10:30 - Lorenzo: I just don't like it haha
9/8/19, 10:31 - Marco: Yeah i get it
9/8/19, 10:31 - Marco: I can understand that it's really not your stile
9/8/19, 10:31 - Marco: Style
9/8/19, 10:31 - Lorenzo: dunno I don't connect with him
9/8/19, 10:31 - Marco: Yeah that's understandable
9/8/19, 10:31 - Lorenzo: at lowlands there was a 'so called' hiphop night
9/8/19, 10:32 - Lorenzo: that kinda sucked
9/8/19, 10:32 - Marco: But a lot of people, and I wont make names but they say that drake is too mainstream and his music is all the same just to hate on him
9/8/19, 10:32 - Lorenzo: and there was also a drake song ofc
9/8/19, 10:32 - Marco: Cause he's famous and all
9/8/19, 10:32 - Marco: And "you gotta act alternative in this world of sheeps" you kno
9/8/19, 10:32 - Lorenzo: and it's the older one
9/8/19, 10:32 - Marco: So they just hate on him for the sake of it
9/8/19, 10:32 - Lorenzo: where he goes from one song to a different one
9/8/19, 10:32 - Marco: Which one
9/8/19, 10:32 - Marco: Oh
9/8/19, 10:32 - Marco: Sicko mode
9/8/19, 10:33 - Marco: That song is also crazy to me
9/8/19, 10:33 - Lorenzo: no
9/8/19, 10:33 - Lorenzo: no
9/8/19, 10:33 - Marco: Oh
9/8/19, 10:33 - Marco: Then idk he has many
9/8/19, 10:33 - Lorenzo: the one with the mountains in em
9/8/19, 10:33 - Marco: Let me listen to it
9/8/19, 10:33 - Lorenzo: I don't know the name
9/8/19, 10:33 - Lorenzo: that's the problem
9/8/19, 10:33 - Lorenzo: haha
9/8/19, 10:38 - Marco: No I also dont know
9/8/19, 10:38 - Lorenzo: haha scrolling through the videos
9/8/19, 10:38 - Lorenzo: I see 'over' again
9/8/19, 10:38 - Lorenzo: and that song really feels like he's just gibbering over the chorus
9/8/19, 10:39 - Marco: Yeah maybe he does that but I feel like it's on purpose
9/8/19, 10:39 - Lorenzo: although the sample is nie
9/8/19, 10:39 - Marco: Because he can rap
9/8/19, 10:39 - Lorenzo: nice *
9/8/19, 10:39 - Marco: He has flow even if the lyrics sometimes lack content
9/8/19, 10:39 - Lorenzo: with the violin
9/8/19, 10:39 - Marco: Most of the times actually
9/8/19, 10:39 - Marco: But again, I watch drake from more of a producer standpoint
9/8/19, 10:39 - Lorenzo: okay let me explain the song
9/8/19, 10:40 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
9/8/19, 10:41 - Marco: I never listened to the early drake, like before 2013
9/8/19, 10:42 - Marco: Like a couple songs but he sounds like something completely different
9/8/19, 10:42 - Lorenzo: I think it's after that
9/8/19, 10:42 - Marco: From 2013 on I feel like he has assumed more of a solidified identity
9/8/19, 10:42 - Marco: Over?
9/8/19, 10:42 - Lorenzo: after 2013
9/8/19, 10:42 - Marco: Over is not after 2013
9/8/19, 10:42 - Lorenzo: jxkldspkodscdk
9/8/19, 10:42 - Lorenzo: no
9/8/19, 10:42 - Lorenzo: I don't mean the song Over
9/8/19, 10:42 - Marco: Oh
9/8/19, 10:42 - Lorenzo: I mean the fucking song that I'm searching for hahahahaha
9/8/19, 10:43 - Marco: Oooh hahah
9/8/19, 10:43 - Marco: Ok let me think
9/8/19, 10:43 - Marco: No idk
9/8/19, 10:44 - Marco: But to summarize what my opinion of drake is in one sentence
9/8/19, 10:44 - Marco: I think what he does always defines the present and gives a glimpse of the future
9/8/19, 10:44 - Marco: That's what I think
9/8/19, 10:47 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
9/8/19, 10:49 - Marco: Yeah exactly
9/8/19, 10:50 - Lorenzo: Drake is aware of the hype
9/8/19, 10:50 - Marco: No
9/8/19, 10:50 - Marco: Drake is the hype
9/8/19, 10:50 - Lorenzo: let me finish haha
9/8/19, 10:50 - Marco: Hahaha
9/8/19, 10:50 - Marco: Ok
9/8/19, 10:50 - Lorenzo: I'm giving him a compliment
9/8/19, 10:50 - Lorenzo: Drake knows when a song will be a hit song
9/8/19, 10:51 - Lorenzo: Drake isn't the hype because Drake won't be gone in a few years
9/8/19, 10:51 - Marco: I know I was exagerating
9/8/19, 10:51 - Lorenzo: because if he were the hype he'd not be a the hype soon
9/8/19, 10:51 - Marco: But yeah I mean that he's almost in control of the hype
9/8/19, 10:52 - Marco: He decides what is hype or not almost
9/8/19, 10:52 - Marco: But also
9/8/19, 10:52 - Marco: About the people that hate on drake, when I ask them why
9/8/19, 10:52 - Marco: Their answer is at some point always on the line of "too mainstream, everyone listens to him"
9/8/19, 10:52 - Marco: Fucking so??
9/8/19, 10:53 - Marco: And then they listen to asap rocky
9/8/19, 10:53 - Marco: Coherence in a nutshell, the proof that they listen to music only based on trend and not on actual taste
9/8/19, 10:54 - Lorenzo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxTtbSjfKro
9/8/19, 10:58 - Lorenzo: kinda but not sure about that
9/8/19, 10:59 - Marco: Damn
9/8/19, 10:59 - Marco: 'Almost'
9/8/19, 10:59 - Lorenzo: that's because they heard it from someone
9/8/19, 10:59 - Marco: Yeah but even if they didbt
9/8/19, 10:59 - Marco: That's such a stupid point
9/8/19, 10:59 - Marco: Only because something is famous doesnt mean it's bad
9/8/19, 10:59 - Lorenzo: our favorite popular artists sit at the same table haha
9/8/19, 11:00 - Marco: Yeah probably but there is a hierarchy for sure
9/8/19, 11:00 - Lorenzo: ofc
9/8/19, 11:00 - Lorenzo: jews definitely
9/8/19, 11:00 - Marco: Hahaha didnt mean that
9/8/19, 11:00 - Lorenzo: that's the stereotype for record companies
9/8/19, 11:00 - Lorenzo: new jersey businessman
9/8/19, 11:00 - Marco: Ok I gotta get to amsterdam so I better get up from this bed

9/11/19, 12:07 - Lorenzo: Kinda
9/11/19, 12:07 - Marco: for borders
9/11/19, 12:07 - Marco: we can choose what kind of borders to talk about right
9/11/19, 12:07 - Lorenzo: Yeah
9/11/19, 12:07 - Lorenzo: Do you have any questions or ideas
9/11/19, 12:08 - Marco: Uhm no not really
9/11/19, 12:08 - Marco: I need to find an idea
9/11/19, 12:08 - Marco: What kind of borders are you talking about if i can ask
9/11/19, 12:08 - Lorenzo: For me it's a personal border
9/11/19, 12:08 - Lorenzo: The mental border
9/11/19, 12:08 - Marco: Okk
9/11/19, 12:08 - Marco: In a social perspective?
9/11/19, 12:09 - Lorenzo: Kinda anxiety
9/11/19, 12:09 - Lorenzo: Fear
9/11/19, 12:09 - Marco: That's interesting
9/11/19, 12:09 - Lorenzo: Not sure how I will define it
9/11/19, 12:09 - Lorenzo: But for instance I was stuck in the break
9/11/19, 12:09 - Marco: I can imagine how you could represent it visually
9/11/19, 12:10 - Lorenzo: And to break free from the pattern
9/11/19, 12:10 - Lorenzo: You need to step over a mental border that feels like a fortress
9/11/19, 12:11 - Marco: Yes
9/11/19, 12:11 - Lorenzo: So that's my topic
9/11/19, 12:11 - Marco: Alright
9/11/19, 12:11 - Marco: That's cool
9/11/19, 12:11 - Lorenzo: Maybe you can do something about procastination in your process
9/11/19, 12:12 - Marco: Hahahaha yes
9/11/19, 12:12 - Marco: I was thinking about cultural borders or smth
9/11/19, 12:12 - Marco: Cause I dont really wanna talk about myself for a while with what I do at school
9/11/19, 12:12 - Marco: I did it way too much last year to a point where it was cringy
9/11/19, 12:17 - Lorenzo: Explain
9/11/19, 12:18 - Lorenzo: Culture clash?
9/11/19, 12:18 - Marco: Well italians happen to be/act as one of the most ignorant people in the world
9/11/19, 12:18 - Marco: And that's the major cause for the constant instability of our country
9/11/19, 12:19 - Marco: But that's too political
9/11/19, 12:19 - Lorenzo: You don't say🙄
9/11/19, 12:19 - Lorenzo: Joke
9/11/19, 12:19 - Marco: So I also was thinking about the migrants situation
9/11/19, 12:19 - Marco: But idk i will research a bit
9/11/19, 12:19 - Marco: It's true
9/11/19, 12:23 - Lorenzo: Well that's why I asked if it could be about borders in the broadest sense of the word
9/11/19, 12:24 - Marco: Do you remember if she showed examples
9/11/19, 12:25 - Marco: I'll rephrase
9/11/19, 12:25 - Marco: Do you remember any example she made?
9/11/19, 12:26 - Lorenzo: The one in Hungary
9/11/19, 12:27 - Marco: Oh yeah and the one in mexico
9/11/19, 12:27 - Lorenzo: That's saying in ten languages that they can't cross and even will shoot or something
9/11/19, 12:27 - Lorenzo: Yes the Google earth video
9/11/19, 12:28 - Marco: Wtf i dont remember this
9/11/19, 12:42 - Lorenzo: Yeah dunno if it was the same border
9/11/19, 12:44 - Marco: I don't remember at all
9/11/19, 12:44 - Lorenzo: Honest question
9/11/19, 12:45 - Lorenzo: Do you have trouble with focussing?
9/11/19, 12:45 - Lorenzo: As in concentration while teacher is telling stuff
9/11/19, 12:46 - Marco: 110%
9/11/19, 12:46 - Marco: In general
9/11/19, 12:46 - Lorenzo: Ahh
9/11/19, 12:46 - Lorenzo: Okokok
9/11/19, 12:47 - Marco: Hahahah why
9/11/19, 12:48 - Lorenzo: Well sometimes when the teacher is talking you tend to distract me Haha
9/11/19, 12:50 - Marco: Oh
9/11/19, 12:50 - Marco: Rly
9/11/19, 12:50 - Marco: Sorry
9/11/19, 12:50 - Lorenzo: And I think this happens at the moment when the information that you're missing is being told
9/11/19, 12:51 - Marco: Yeah I have big trouble with focusing
9/11/19, 12:51 - Marco: In general
9/11/19, 12:51 - Lorenzo: No problem but thought this could be the reason
9/11/19, 12:54 - Marco: It definitely is a problem for me
9/11/19, 12:54 - Lorenzo: I mean fooling around isn't a bad thing
9/11/19, 12:54 - Lorenzo: Neither is being distracted
9/11/19, 13:01 - Marco: Well it is when it starts affecting your "life performance"
9/11/19, 13:01 - Lorenzo: Cpu
9/11/19, 14:42 - Lorenzo: Question
9/11/19, 14:42 - Lorenzo: Trust is a bad brand right
9/11/19, 14:49 - Marco: Let's just say that their name is not really descriptive of their products
9/11/19, 14:51 - Lorenzo: En Logitech
9/11/19, 14:59 - Marco: Meh
9/11/19, 15:00 - Marco: Technically better
9/11/19, 15:06 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>

9/11/19, 15:31 - Lorenzo: A mouse I mean
9/11/19, 15:31 - Lorenzo: I did buy guitar strings
9/11/19, 15:31 - Marco: Coool
9/11/19, 15:31 - Lorenzo: Just go with one
9/11/19, 15:32 - Marco: Don't you have this thing like
9/11/19, 15:32 - Marco: I really like to talk about big, intense or usually sad matters
9/11/19, 15:32 - Lorenzo: As long as it is you
9/11/19, 15:32 - Marco: But I really have this fear of being looked at as the guy who just makes depressing work
9/11/19, 15:32 - Marco: Yes it is
9/11/19, 15:33 - Marco: I would rather talk about something serious like migrants than something funny in my work
9/11/19, 15:33 - Lorenzo: Yesterday Sarah wanted to make a work with
9/11/19, 15:33 - Lorenzo: Serious things
9/11/19, 15:34 - Lorenzo: Tho it's a humour assignment
9/11/19, 15:35 - Lorenzo: A border Isn't always negative
9/11/19, 15:35 - Marco: I know
9/11/19, 15:35 - Marco: But I don't wanna be funny at all costs
9/11/19, 15:35 - Lorenzo: And don't think too much about this
9/11/19, 15:35 - Marco: What I wanna talk about in my tap story is quite a sad atory
9/11/19, 15:35 - Marco: Story
9/11/19, 15:35 - Lorenzo: Start doing one
9/11/19, 15:35 - Marco: About migrants

9/11/19, 15:36 - Marco: Alright
9/11/19, 15:36 - Lorenzo: If that is not what you want

9/11/19, 15:37 - Marco: Ok Shia Labeouf
9/11/19, 15:37 - Marco: But true it's crazy that I still get stuck in this loops
9/11/19, 15:37 - Marco: Gonna make this
9/11/19, 15:38 - Lorenzo: It's fine
9/11/19, 15:38 - Lorenzo: It's called development
9/11/19, 15:39 - Marco: Oh ye

9/11/19, 16:16 - Marco: Yeah but remember I'm on probation
9/11/19, 16:16 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
9/11/19, 16:16 - Marco: Hahaha wow
9/11/19, 16:16 - Marco: It looks fantastic
9/11/19, 16:16 - Marco: I also have to change strings to my ukulele
9/11/19, 16:16 - Marco: Never done it
9/11/19, 16:16 - Lorenzo: Shit I totally forgot
9/11/19, 16:17 - Marco: Haha didnt expect you to remember
9/11/19, 17:25 - Lorenzo: is t working for you?
9/11/19, 17:26 - Marco: I think so
9/11/19, 17:26 - Marco: I was doing research about the migrants situation and stumbled on this article from last year
9/11/19, 17:26 - Marco: About this van in belgium full of migrants and a girl called mawda being shot by police
9/11/19, 17:27 - Marco: As they were attempting to leave for uk
9/11/19, 17:27 - Marco: I wanna tell the story only with audio
9/11/19, 17:27 - Marco: So all the slides will be black
9/11/19, 17:27 - Marco: Cause that's what you see if you're closed inside a van
9/11/19, 17:28 - Marco: You only hear
9/11/19, 17:28 - Marco: I think it's a nice experiment on a very serious topic
9/11/19, 17:29 - Marco: What do you think
9/11/19, 17:30 - Lorenzo: hmm
9/11/19, 17:30 - Lorenzo: it's cool
9/11/19, 17:30 - Marco: Be honest haha
9/11/19, 17:30 - Marco: I still have time to do something else
9/11/19, 17:30 - Lorenzo: well is it too much work to do
9/11/19, 17:30 - Marco: Not at all
9/11/19, 17:31 - Marco: It's actually simpler cause i don't have to use images or visual input
9/11/19, 17:31 - Marco: And it's very short, I sure can make it in time, that's not the point
9/11/19, 17:31 - Marco: But what you think of the idea
9/11/19, 17:32 - Lorenzo: well
9/11/19, 17:32 - Lorenzo: keep in mind that it still is visual storytelling
9/11/19, 17:32 - Marco: Uhm yeah but audio is a way of visualizing
9/11/19, 17:33 - Marco: Quote by johan
9/11/19, 17:34 - Lorenzo: I'm kinda trying to write my story down
9/11/19, 17:34 - Marco: How is it coming along
9/11/19, 17:37 - Lorenzo: I will read it, but this is a first thing:

9/12/19, 09:31 - Marco: Why
9/12/19, 09:32 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
9/12/19, 09:32 - Marco: Is it just a terrible typo that has grown his roots in the language
9/12/19, 09:32 - Marco: Hahahah ok calm down

9/12/19, 09:38 - Lorenzo: yes
9/12/19, 09:38 - Marco: Understandable
9/12/19, 09:41 - Lorenzo: I mean I'm also glad that Hillary or Bernie didn't make it (despite the fact I kinda like Sanders but he's not a president)
9/12/19, 09:41 - Lorenzo: don't get me wrong, I despise Trump
9/12/19, 09:42 - Lorenzo: but the way people talk about him is hyped and should've also been done about the previous POTUS
9/12/19, 09:42 - Lorenzo: Obama ain't a saint
9/12/19, 09:42 - Lorenzo: haha
9/12/19, 09:54 - Marco: No for sure
9/12/19, 09:54 - Marco: But he ain't a complete sick in the head idiot either
9/12/19, 09:54 - Marco: Not comparable to trump
9/12/19, 09:55 - Marco: Or maybe you cant really compare them
9/12/19, 09:55 - Lorenzo: true
9/12/19, 09:55 - Lorenzo: but he's a puppet

9/12/19, 09:55 - Marco: That's really sad, I read something more incredibile everyday that he does or says or tweet
9/12/19, 09:56 - Marco: I wonder how is it possible that they didnt get to impeach him
9/12/19, 09:56 - Lorenzo: I stopped doing that
9/12/19, 09:56 - Marco: People have become too lazy to actually get out there and protest
9/12/19, 09:56 - Marco: Like hong kong for example
9/12/19, 09:56 - Lorenzo: well pence worse
9/12/19, 09:56 - Marco: Worse what
9/12/19, 09:57 - Lorenzo: If Trump would get impeached
9/12/19, 09:57 - Lorenzo: that would mean Mike Pence would be the president
9/12/19, 09:57 - Lorenzo: and his ideas are worse than Trump's
9/12/19, 09:57 - Marco: Oh
9/12/19, 09:57 - Marco: Are they

9/22/19, 13:05 - Marco: I knew kind of the meaning but I didnt know it was specifically about 9/11 but it makes sense

9/27/19, 09:18 - Lorenzo: By the way
9/27/19, 09:19 - Lorenzo: You know I said Wednesday about stuff that happened
9/27/19, 09:28 - Marco: Yess
9/27/19, 09:30 - Lorenzo: My grandmother has been in the hospital for the last month and was planned to go in a hospice
9/27/19, 09:31 - Lorenzo: But yesterday she was feeling worse and the hospital couldn't do anything anymore
9/27/19, 09:31 - Marco: Oh shit
9/27/19, 09:31 - Marco: I'm very very sorry
9/27/19, 09:32 - Marco: There is really no way it can get better?
9/27/19, 09:32 - Lorenzo: And yesterday she said she didn't want to suffer anymore so we went to say goodbye or take leave
9/27/19, 09:32 - Marco: I can really relate cause my grandfather is in the same situation
9/27/19, 09:32 - Marco: So I think I understand a part of what you're going through and I'm sorry
9/27/19, 09:32 - Lorenzo: 'afscheid nemen'
9/27/19, 09:32 - Marco: Damn, that's rough
9/27/19, 09:33 - Marco: I'm really sorry, if there is anything I can do tell me
9/27/19, 09:33 - Lorenzo: She was put into artificial coma
9/27/19, 09:33 - Marco: And it's not just one of those usual circumstance sentences
9/27/19, 09:33 - Marco: I mean it
9/27/19, 09:33 - Lorenzo: No euthanasia
9/27/19, 09:33 - Lorenzo: So she passed away last night
9/27/19, 09:34 - Marco: Damn, I'm really sorry, my condolences
9/27/19, 09:34 - Lorenzo: Which I'm truly sad about but morely relieved because her soul has been released
9/27/19, 09:34 - Marco: I know it may be hurtful but it will pass for sure
9/27/19, 09:34 - Marco: That's true, that's a good way to see it also
9/27/19, 09:35 - Lorenzo: Yeah I also slept well
9/27/19, 09:35 - Marco: That's really important to cope with something like that
9/27/19, 09:35 - Marco: Hopefully you're feeling better today
9/27/19, 09:35 - Lorenzo: Yes well I don't feel bad or depressed or something
9/27/19, 09:35 - Lorenzo: Just natural sadness
9/27/19, 09:36 - Marco: Yes, she had a good life hopefully?
9/27/19, 09:36 - Lorenzo: My family is one that cries but doesn't wallow in self-pity
9/27/19, 09:37 - Lorenzo: So the best way to cope is to continue
9/27/19, 09:37 - Marco: Yes it is
9/27/19, 09:37 - Lorenzo: You have seen the fountain right
9/27/19, 09:37 - Marco: Take example from her qualities and carry them on during your life

9/27/19, 09:39 - Lorenzo: Our bodies are prisons for our souls. Our skin and blood, the iron bars of confinement. But, fear not. All flesh decays. Death turns all to ash. And thus, death frees every soul.
9/27/19, 09:41 - Marco: Yes that's a positive way of thinking
9/27/19, 10:26 - Lorenzo: True

10/8/19, 14:35 - Marco: We didnt take it from other people's gardens
10/8/19, 14:35 - Marco: Yeah I also told him it's a weird idea
10/8/19, 14:35 - Marco: And no one is gonna accept it
10/8/19, 14:35 - Lorenzo: then why would he say that
10/8/19, 14:35 - Marco: So I suggested him a variation
10/8/19, 14:36 - Lorenzo: oh well fuck it
10/8/19, 14:37 - Lorenzo: he should've explained it better
10/8/19, 14:38 - Lorenzo: where the fuck did he get them from then?
10/8/19, 14:39 - Lorenzo: I'm confued now lol
10/8/19, 14:39 - Marco: The city
10/8/19, 14:40 - Lorenzo: bit more precise
10/8/19, 14:40 - Marco: Plants in the streets
10/8/19, 14:40 - Lorenzo: eh
10/8/19, 14:40 - Lorenzo: okay
10/8/19, 14:40 - Marco: Yeah also not better
10/8/19, 14:40 - Marco: I don't think the concept is appropriate but whatever
10/8/19, 14:41 - Marco: I don't really care/mind too much
10/8/19, 14:41 - Lorenzo: I mean trying to make a garden in a non garden space is one thing
10/8/19, 14:41 - Lorenzo: but stealing imo very low
10/8/19, 14:42 - Marco: I do agree
10/8/19, 14:42 - Lorenzo: if you're too poor and need to survive shure
10/8/19, 14:42 - Lorenzo: sure*
10/8/19, 14:43 - Lorenzo: but we are privileged art school people xd
10/8/19, 14:43 - Marco: Yeah I totally agree with you
10/8/19, 14:43 - Lorenzo: "look at us making a statement" smh
10/8/19, 14:43 - Marco: When I went there I didnt even know what we were shooting for
10/8/19, 14:43 - Marco: It kinda came out after a while
10/8/19, 14:44 - Lorenzo: disgusting hahaha
10/8/19, 14:44 - Marco: And I told him it doesn't make any sensw
10/8/19, 14:44 - Marco: But I don't care/mind enough atm honestly
10/8/19, 14:44 - Marco: It's not made with bad intentions for sure
10/8/19, 14:44 - Marco: Just not really good execution
10/8/19, 14:45 - Lorenzo: idiotic gesture never comes from bad intentions 
because it isn't thought through in the first place
10/8/19, 14:45 - Marco: Yeah that's the impression I had when I made him notice
10/8/19, 14:46 - Lorenzo: I'm now just confused and flabbergasted by this utterly stupid idea
10/8/19, 14:46 - Marco: I read this in a scottish accent
10/8/19, 14:46 - Lorenzo: he said it's fine not to join but I just wonder how do you think of this
10/8/19, 14:46 - Marco: I told you and I told him
10/8/19, 14:46 - Marco: I don't agree and I wont be the only one for sure
10/8/19, 14:46 - Marco: Especially in that school
10/8/19, 14:47 - Lorenzo: Geezers need excitement
If there lives don't provide them they stay incite violence
Common sense, simple common sense
10/8/19, 14:47 - Lorenzo: haha
10/8/19, 14:48 - Lorenzo: in my most sophisticated british I'd call this utterly nonsensical haha
10/8/19, 14:54 - Marco: Hahahahaha
10/8/19, 15:35 - Lorenzo: I think I'll bring my last kitchen waste tomorrow
10/8/19, 15:36 - Marco: Why last
10/8/19, 15:36 - Lorenzo: I don't feel connected with that garden as I thought I would
10/8/19, 16:07 - Lorenzo: And to be honest the concept demotivates me
10/8/19, 18:15 - Marco: Yeah I can imagine
10/8/19, 18:15 - Marco: Same for me
10/8/19, 18:17 - Lorenzo: Thank you
10/9/19, 09:22 - Lorenzo: Question

10/9/19, 09:25 - Lorenzo: I'll think about it
10/9/19, 09:26 - Lorenzo: I don't feel connected to the garden
10/9/19, 09:26 - Lorenzo: I'm not feeling the Saturday garden shift
10/9/19, 09:27 - Lorenzo: One thing I know is that I won't be bringing anymore kitchen waste
10/9/19, 09:28 - Lorenzo: It doesn't feel very grateful
10/9/19, 09:30 - Lorenzo: Besides I'm not partaking in the last month
10/9/19, 09:31 - Lorenzo: The thought has been about more than one's stupid idea
10/9/19, 09:39 - Marco: Find your way to be connected to the garden
10/9/19, 09:40 - Marco: And don't connect it too much to what other people do
10/9/19, 09:40 - Lorenzo: :)

10/14/19, 22:17 - Lorenzo: I'm glad I still managed to do that rendering
10/14/19, 22:17 - Lorenzo: I'm gonna improve it but at least I tried to do it and that gives more satisfaction than bringing nothing
10/14/19, 23:28 - Marco: Ofc
10/14/19, 23:28 - Marco: <Media omitted>
10/15/19, 01:10 - Marco: Hahah stupid bitch
10/15/19, 01:11 - Marco: But thank you very much, you can't imagine how it helped
10/15/19, 01:11 - Marco: How much
10/15/19, 01:16 - Marco: That's true I'm giving her way too much relevance by just putting any effort in ignoring her, I should really stop and just be respectful and stop to that, I'll try me best
10/15/19, 08:01 - Lorenzo: Exactly
10/15/19, 08:02 - Lorenzo: Just woke up, now 7:50 instead of 5:15
10/15/19, 08:32 - Marco: Great
10/15/19, 08:33 - Marco: I went to sleep at 4.15
10/15/19, 08:38 - Lorenzo: sounds like you chose for it
10/15/19, 08:38 - Lorenzo: wow
10/15/19, 08:42 - Marco: Yes I did sir
10/15/19, 08:42 - Marco: I stayed to make things for today
10/15/19, 08:42 - Marco: Actually very willingly
10/15/19, 08:43 - Marco: I wasnt even tired (which I am now)
10/15/19, 08:43 - Lorenzo: haha well yeah I didn't make a better design yet but I want to do that during class today
10/15/19, 08:43 - Marco: Yeah I'll work on a clay model today
10/15/19, 08:44 - Lorenzo: I'm confused bc I brought one today
10/15/19, 08:44 - Lorenzo: last week*
10/15/19, 08:44 - Lorenzo: but he looked at my design last week
10/15/19, 09:07 - Marco: Today we have to dress up
10/15/19, 09:12 - Lorenzo: Hahaha
10/15/19, 09:13 - Lorenzo: So Jeroen managed to get a dress
10/15/19, 09:16 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
10/15/19, 09:20 - Marco: Idk
10/15/19, 09:20 - Marco: Wooow
10/15/19, 09:21 - Lorenzo: Then why you say it
10/15/19, 09:34 - Marco: Cause that's the intention
10/15/19, 09:34 - Marco: And I doubt that jeroen forgot
10/15/19, 09:35 - Lorenzo: Lol yeah
10/15/19, 09:35 - Lorenzo: And our class is so good in intentions, punctuality and doing what has to be done even when every exact step has been told🙃
10/15/19, 10:11 - Marco: Ahahahaha
10/15/19, 14:26 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
10/15/19, 14:48 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
10/15/19, 16:01 - Marco: Wat u think o' my proposal
10/15/19, 16:08 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
10/15/19, 16:08 - Marco: occ
10/15/19, 16:14 - Lorenzo: You mean like
10/15/19, 16:14 - Lorenzo: Tell your actual emotions
10/15/19, 16:16 - Lorenzo: Instead of me saying something and i.e. not true because he experiences it differently and I'm being shushed cause I would not feel part of the class?
10/15/19, 16:16 - Marco: Yeah
10/15/19, 16:16 - Marco: We already tried this method last year and it never worked
10/15/19, 16:17 - Marco: Because people are too afraid to "compromise' themselves
10/15/19, 16:17 - Marco: Or because they don't necessarily want to be seen as the ones who think that specific bad thing
10/15/19, 16:18 - Marco: I think that's reasonable
10/15/19, 16:18 - Marco: But then we have to use a method that allows to spit the real t you know what I'm sayin
10/15/19, 16:19 - Lorenzo: When  someone  shares,  the  group  should  control  the  urge  to  react  or  interrupt.  There  are  a  few  exceptions  where  the situation  requires  it.  In  the  case  of  confusion  or  emotion  for  example.  Then  we  may  respond  with  questions  such  as:  is there  something  you  need?  is  there  anything  we  can  do  for  you?  et  cetera.
10/15/19, 16:19 - Marco: And if there are still problems unsloved after all these structured efforts to solve stuff it means that not all the truth is coming oit
10/15/19, 16:19 - Marco: Out
10/15/19, 16:19 - Lorenzo: This tone like
10/15/19, 16:19 - Lorenzo: _sorry to hear that and that you are experiencing this because you might be wrong_
10/15/19, 16:20 - Marco: Hahaha
10/15/19, 16:20 - Marco: Yeah
10/15/19, 16:20 - Marco: All this apologetic attitude
10/15/19, 16:20 - Marco: This forced political correctness
10/15/19, 16:20 - Marco: Will never make anyone be honest
10/15/19, 16:20 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
10/15/19, 16:20 - Marco: Everyone will say the truth that may hurt the least people possible
10/15/19, 16:20 - Marco: But in order to change and get better you have to accept the possibility of being hurt
10/15/19, 16:21 - Marco: and of being compromised
10/15/19, 16:21 - Marco: And most importantly
10/15/19, 16:21 - Marco: They have to accept the possibility that not everyone may see every problem
10/15/19, 16:21 - Marco: Like that thing that you said yesterdat
10/15/19, 16:22 - Marco: About the fact that many people still act like high school
10/15/19, 16:22 - Marco: That there are the "cool peeps" and the others
10/15/19, 16:22 - Marco: 100% true
10/15/19, 16:22 - Marco: And if you're not gonna say it I'm gonna
10/15/19, 16:22 - Marco: I think it's one of the main problems of this class
10/15/19, 16:23 - Lorenzo: True
10/15/19, 16:23 - Marco: Hahah
10/15/19, 16:23 - Marco: thanks
10/15/19, 16:23 - Marco: end of the convpo
10/15/19, 16:23 - Marco: bb
10/15/19, 16:24 - Marco: But do you think it's a good proposal?
10/15/19, 16:24 - Marco: The one I made on the group
10/15/19, 16:24 - Marco: I mean do you agree
10/15/19, 16:24 - Lorenzo: Kinda? I'm kinda numb atm

10/15/19, 16:25 - Lorenzo: Thinking I should cook rice or stamppot
10/15/19, 16:26 - Marco: i don't know what the latter is
10/15/19, 16:26 - Lorenzo: the wut
10/15/19, 16:27 - Marco: the second of the two things you said
10/15/19, 16:27 - Lorenzo: Andive mixed with mashed potatoes
10/15/19, 16:27 - Marco: Cool
10/15/19, 16:28 - Lorenzo: _And I knooiiow I may eeeeend up faaaailing toooo_
_But I knooooow you were just like meeee with someone disappoiiointed in youuuu_

10/15/19, 16:29 - Marco: ahahahaha
10/15/19, 16:29 - Marco: the amount of hate on that song
10/15/19, 16:29 - Marco: and btw
10/15/19, 16:30 - Marco: jeroen seeing the message and not answering
10/15/19, 16:30 - Lorenzo: Hybrid theory, reanimation and meteora are big fundaments in my musical heritage
10/15/19, 16:30 - Marco: great start for a very respectful and healthy discussion :)
10/15/19, 16:30 - Marco: ReCheck yosself
10/15/19, 16:30 - Marco: before I ReWreck yosself
10/15/19, 16:31 - Lorenzo: probably getting a huge egoboner out of leading something again
10/15/19, 16:31 - Marco: Jesus fucking h motherfucking christ
10/15/19, 16:31 - Lorenzo: He's kind and all
10/15/19, 16:31 - Marco: yeah but he's making kindness a reason to be boastful
10/15/19, 16:31 - Lorenzo: But he lives to do this taking the lead
10/15/19, 16:31 - Marco: and a borderline douchebag
10/15/19, 16:31 - Lorenzo: Boasty
10/15/19, 16:32 - Marco: I think it's fine to be taking the lead
10/15/19, 16:32 - Marco: But not for the sake of it
10/15/19, 16:32 - Lorenzo: WoooOooOoow
10/15/19, 16:32 - Marco: I said borderline
10/15/19, 16:32 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
10/15/19, 16:32 - Marco: When you push some kind of behaviour too much you're always a douchebag
10/15/19, 16:32 - Marco: I mean sure
10/15/19, 16:32 - Marco: ""
10/15/19, 16:33 - Marco: I can hear his voice
10/15/19, 16:33 - Marco: I'm fine with him
10/15/19, 16:33 - Marco: It's just that when I criticize someone's trait I go all out
10/15/19, 16:33 - Marco: Every time
10/15/19, 16:33 - Marco: Doesn't mean I hate him or anything
10/15/19, 16:33 - Marco: He has good and bad sides like everyone
10/15/19, 16:34 - Marco: And I'm all about calling out those spicy bad sides
10/15/19, 16:34 - Lorenzo: _borderliiiine_
10/15/19, 16:34 - Lorenzo: _love isn't always on time_
10/15/19, 16:34 - Marco: Ahahahah
10/15/19, 16:35 - Marco: WoWoWow
10/15/19, 16:35 - Lorenzo: Jaaaa
10/15/19, 16:35 - Marco: I was hooked to that song until 1 week ago
10/15/19, 16:35 - Marco: Thank you for having reminded me again
10/15/19, 16:35 - Lorenzo: You know when you call a company
10/15/19, 16:35 - Lorenzo: And they let you hold the line
10/15/19, 16:36 - Marco: Yes
10/15/19, 16:36 - Marco: They should use that song
10/15/19, 16:36 - Lorenzo: Well the housing thing where I rent from
10/15/19, 16:36 - Lorenzo: Do this
10/15/19, 16:36 - Marco: Hahahahah wow
10/15/19, 16:36 - Marco: They have all my respect
10/15/19, 16:37 - Lorenzo: I think Jeroen is funny
10/15/19, 16:37 - Lorenzo: Art school is too loose for him
10/15/19, 16:37 - Lorenzo: Yet he quit university cause it's too tight
10/15/19, 16:38 - Marco: what you mean loose
10/15/19, 16:38 - Lorenzo: Disorganized
10/15/19, 16:38 - Marco: ooh
10/15/19, 16:38 - Marco: yeah idk
10/15/19, 16:38 - Marco: i think he's fine
10/15/19, 16:38 - Marco: just needs to stop with this attitude
10/15/19, 16:38 - Marco: because he also has a bit of this cool kid attitude
10/15/19, 16:39 - Marco: but not too much
10/15/19, 16:39 - Marco: but in these cases it's annoying that he showcases his ideas as if he knows that they will work for sure at the end
10/15/19, 16:40 - Lorenzo: The moment he said I should use a vippassana retreat meditation to cure the fact I can't ride a bike
10/15/19, 16:40 - Lorenzo: That was so beautifully considered and ignorant at the same time
10/15/19, 16:40 - Marco: Hahahah
10/15/19, 16:40 - Marco: wtf
10/15/19, 16:40 - Marco: why would he say that
10/15/19, 16:41 - Lorenzo: I mean he s positive about the effect
10/15/19, 16:42 - Lorenzo: He sometimes reminds me of the nice guy in a movie who sometimes seems perfect and always doing good
10/15/19, 16:42 - Marco: chad
10/15/19, 16:43 - Lorenzo: I.e. the reason Mr peanut butter exists in bojack
10/15/19, 16:43 - Marco: ahahahhahahahahahahahahahah
10/15/19, 16:43 - Marco: omg
10/15/19, 16:43 - Marco: never thought about it
10/15/19, 16:43 - Marco: ahahahahha
10/15/19, 16:43 - Lorenzo: He's exactly that archetype
10/15/19, 16:43 - Marco: ahahahahahahah
10/15/19, 16:43 - Marco: i'm in tears
10/15/19, 16:43 - Marco: amazing comparison, made my day
10/15/19, 16:43 - Marco: hahahah
10/15/19, 16:43 - Marco: but how do you cope with people like this
10/15/19, 16:43 - Marco: i mean
10/15/19, 16:44 - Marco: it's also a coping method, his
10/15/19, 16:44 - Lorenzo: Idk I'm a different person
10/15/19, 16:44 - Lorenzo: And there's always this cool kid
10/15/19, 16:45 - Lorenzo: And some people need this person in their environment
10/15/19, 16:45 - Marco: yeah but it's not healthy
10/15/19, 16:45 - Lorenzo: I don't
10/15/19, 16:45 - Marco: forced positivity
10/15/19, 16:45 - Marco: never
10/15/19, 16:45 - Lorenzo: Well people just deal with it
10/15/19, 16:45 - Lorenzo: I just leave it as it is
10/15/19, 16:46 - Marco: yeah
10/15/19, 16:46 - Marco: true
10/15/19, 16:46 - Lorenzo: The fact that Jeroen is hardly ever admits he's wrong
10/15/19, 16:47 - Lorenzo: Projecting in how someone else does instead of saying he's wrong about something
10/15/19, 16:48 - Lorenzo: Except if you bring it in his lingo
10/15/19, 16:48 - Marco: but all of this makes me think then that he's a fraud
10/15/19, 16:48 - Marco: showcasing all this positivity just to hide from others and himself something unsolved
10/15/19, 16:48 - Marco: but also it's none of my business
10/15/19, 16:48 - Lorenzo: So maybe he just doesn't understand it in his thought pattern
10/15/19, 16:49 - Lorenzo: Well yeah puppy eyed depressed face comes from somewhere
10/15/19, 16:49 - Marco: being adults is way more difficult than it looks like when you're a kid
10/15/19, 16:49 - Marco: a thing that i've realized lately
10/15/19, 16:49 - Lorenzo: Will never forget they exaggerated 😔🥺 presentation
10/15/19, 16:50 - Lorenzo: That*
10/15/19, 16:50 - Marco: and it came to me like a fucking metheorite over my head
10/15/19, 16:50 - Marco: no ahah
10/15/19, 16:50 - Lorenzo: I'm just speaking my mind tho
10/15/19, 16:50 - Marco: But I'm really realizing it many more people that I would have ever thought
10/15/19, 16:51 - Marco: How many have their behaviours just as a defense mechanism from something they don't have the bravery to cope with
10/15/19, 16:51 - Lorenzo: Red alert
10/15/19, 16:51 - Marco: I think I know 3 or 4 people that don't have this
10/15/19, 16:51 - Lorenzo: This is a bit complex matter imo
10/15/19, 16:51 - Marco: or maybe they have it but at least they are aware
10/15/19, 16:51 - Marco: and show intention in changing
10/15/19, 16:52 - Lorenzo: There's a reason I talk to the people I talk to in school
10/15/19, 16:52 - Marco: I mean what I think is that being adult is being aware of both the qualities and the faults, and the bravery and will to fix those faults
10/15/19, 16:52 - Lorenzo: EQ
10/15/19, 16:52 - Marco: wym
10/15/19, 16:53 - Marco: I always say that I changed a lot during last year and I've been more depressed than I ever thought possible, and most of it just came from various episodes of realization of the fact that I have big things that need to be changed
10/15/19, 16:53 - Marco: But some people really cover their eyes in front of this kinda truth
10/15/19, 16:54 - Marco: Sometimes for their whole life, until they forget it

10/15/19, 17:47 - Marco: I didn't mean to put myself in a presumptuous position, but you're right
10/15/19, 17:47 - Marco: I assume too much maybe
10/15/19, 17:47 - Lorenzo: You're a human
10/15/19, 17:49 - Lorenzo: Thank you rice is a good choice
10/15/19, 17:59 - Marco: ahahahha

10/26/19, 19:41 - Marco: I'm not gonna use the one I got in class
10/26/19, 19:43 - Lorenzo: Wanna hear the secret I got
10/26/19, 19:43 - Lorenzo: Or not
10/26/19, 19:43 - Marco: Sure
10/26/19, 19:44 - Lorenzo: _I do drugs (quite often
10/26/19, 19:44 - Marco: Hahahahahaha
10/26/19, 19:44 - Lorenzo: )
10/26/19, 19:44 - Marco: Uhmmmm
10/26/19, 19:44 - Marco: Hmmmmm
10/26/19, 19:44 - Marco: I can take a very very very wild guess
10/26/19, 19:44 - Lorenzo: No idea
10/26/19, 19:44 - Marco: But maybe it's someone more unexpected
10/26/19, 19:45 - Marco: It's not me btw, that's an idiot thing to boast about
10/26/19, 19:45 - Lorenzo: Wies or Roberto or Izzy or Jeroen or anyone
10/26/19, 19:45 - Marco: Izzy?
10/26/19, 19:45 - Lorenzo: Right?
10/26/19, 19:45 - Marco: Not jeroen
10/26/19, 19:45 - Marco: Yeah imo
10/26/19, 19:45 - Marco: I would think it's most likely wies' but not sure
10/26/19, 19:45 - Marco: Maybe not
10/26/19, 19:46 - Marco: Maybe it's
10/26/19, 19:46 - Marco: Alexia
10/26/19, 19:46 - Marco: Or xiao yao
10/26/19, 19:46 - Lorenzo: Simbu😂
10/26/19, 19:46 - Marco: Hahahah
10/26/19, 19:46 - Marco: No idk the only one I can imagine boasting about that is wies
10/26/19, 19:46 - Lorenzo: Hahahaha could be but it's not her style
10/26/19, 19:47 - Marco: Or roberto but roberto only smokes, unless wies influenced him so much that now he does other stuff too
10/26/19, 19:47 - Marco: Maybe sarah
10/26/19, 19:48 - Marco: Yeah it's one of them 3 but idc
10/26/19, 19:49 - Lorenzo: Hmye
10/26/19, 19:49 - Marco: What
10/26/19, 19:49 - Marco: <Media omitted>
10/26/19, 19:50 - Lorenzo: ?
10/26/19, 19:50 - Marco: Oh it's hm ye
10/26/19, 19:50 - Lorenzo: Ye
10/26/19, 19:50 - Marco: Idk I don't think wies would boast about it actually, maybe a while ago
10/26/19, 19:51 - Marco: But what she told me a while ago is that she would stop with drugs
10/26/19, 19:51 - Marco: I don't know and care if it actually happened
10/26/19, 19:51 - Marco: But shitty secret nevertheless
10/26/19, 19:53 - Lorenzo: Such a stupid obsessed secret
10/26/19, 20:00 - Lorenzo: Truly not in the most friendly writing mode
10/26/19, 20:01 - Lorenzo: Keep on writing stuff like "I'm so special, I'm doing it because everyone else is doing it out of peer pressure as well"
10/26/19, 20:02 - Lorenzo: Thing is I'm fairly against drug abuse and people intentionally being destructive
10/26/19, 20:12 - Lorenzo: I'm made it into a story that the narrator uses this as a cover up for her bad behaviour
10/26/19, 20:38 - Marco: Well I mean that's the sane way to think
10/26/19, 20:38 - Marco: Smary
10/26/19, 20:38 - Marco: Big brain
10/26/19, 20:44 - Lorenzo: ?
10/26/19, 22:18 - Marco: Smart

10/27/19, 09:46 - Lorenzo: oh
10/27/19, 09:46 - Marco: But I'm gonna have fun nevertheless
10/27/19, 09:46 - Lorenzo: if my legs weren't as dead as they are I'd join you
10/27/19, 09:46 - Marco: Np
10/27/19, 09:46 - Lorenzo: going alone?
10/27/19, 09:46 - Marco: Yess
10/27/19, 09:47 - Lorenzo: nice, on your way already?
10/27/19, 09:47 - Marco: No just woke up hahaha
10/27/19, 09:47 - Lorenzo: aah okay well it's until 18:00 so keep that in mind
10/27/19, 09:47 - Marco: Really
10/27/19, 09:47 - Lorenzo: is it weird to feel guilty not having done  shit because I took some rest and had fun? xd
10/27/19, 09:48 - Marco: Not at all
10/27/19, 09:48 - Marco: I didnt know it finished so early
10/27/19, 09:48 - Marco: Fucc

10/28/19, 12:44 - Lorenzo: sharing our secrets
10/28/19, 12:44 - Lorenzo: I didn't for the first time
10/28/19, 12:45 - Marco: Why
10/28/19, 12:45 - Lorenzo: I wasn't really happy with it
10/28/19, 13:15 - Lorenzo: Jeroen liked it, which kinda is a surprise
10/28/19, 13:15 - Lorenzo: also next time just come to class even though how busy you are

even tho it's your choice, just sharing my experience
10/28/19, 13:39 - Marco: I really needed this time
10/28/19, 14:33 - Lorenzo: Ofc I understand

10/28/19, 14:33 - Marco: Later
10/28/19, 14:34 - Lorenzo: Ok
10/28/19, 15:32 - Marco: Until a certain point it really sounded like a portrait of Wies
10/28/19, 15:32 - Marco: Sorry if that was not your intention haha
10/28/19, 15:32 - Lorenzo: HAHAHAHHAA
10/28/19, 15:32 - Marco: The last couple sentences saved it
10/28/19, 15:33 - Lorenzo: I was/n't?
10/28/19, 15:33 - Marco: But it was so incredibly accurate
10/28/19, 15:33 - Marco: If it was, mad respect for putting out your opinions about it so fiercely
10/28/19, 15:33 - Marco: Anyway, very moving
10/28/19, 15:33 - Lorenzo: you should wies who got my story
10/28/19, 15:33 - Lorenzo: read*
10/28/19, 15:33 - Lorenzo: secret
10/28/19, 15:34 - Marco: Hahahah
10/28/19, 15:34 - Marco: What

10/28/19, 15:59 - Lorenzo: I also said like ah so you made it personal
10/28/19, 16:08 - Marco: Hahahahah
10/28/19, 16:08 - Marco: Why did she write that way
10/28/19, 16:14 - Lorenzo: Idk
10/28/19, 16:16 - Lorenzo: It's kinda funny in the beginning and after that I feel like having a brain aneurysm

10/28/19, 17:11 - Lorenzo: you seem so stressed
10/28/19, 17:11 - Lorenzo: why are you stressed
10/28/19, 17:11 - Marco: I'm not stressed, but even though I put all the effort in bettering myself and my way to cope with things I still now and then get this stupid mood swings
10/28/19, 17:12 - Lorenzo: oohh
10/28/19, 17:12 - Marco: Getting completely gloomy and hopeless out of nowhere
10/28/19, 17:12 - Marco: That's stressing
10/28/19, 17:12 - Lorenzo: hmhm yeah I get it
10/28/19, 17:12 - Marco: Soo yeah but now it's better
10/28/19, 17:12 - Lorenzo: needed an extra day
10/28/19, 17:12 - Marco: Not really
10/28/19, 17:12 - Marco: I wasn't planning to ditch today until this morning in bed
10/28/19, 17:13 - Lorenzo: well don't beat yourself up about it
10/28/19, 17:13 - Marco: And I had to do a lot of stuff but I've been super slow because of this
10/28/19, 17:13 - Marco: Like a rusty clockwork
10/28/19, 17:13 - Lorenzo: that's how I felt before the break
10/28/19, 17:13 - Marco: I'm not but teachers don't really care about this stuff, they care about seeing work done and if I keep getting this it will never happen
10/28/19, 17:14 - Marco: Hopefully it will pass

11/19/19, 23:06 - Lorenzo: Yeah it's a word

12/8/19, 21:07 - Lorenzo: my bio is this
12/8/19, 21:07 - Lorenzo: I study interactive media design. 
My works are based on cynicism, skepticism, humour,  empathy and institutional critique. 
I as an artist am aware of my role as bringer of concepts but I am also aware of my human irony. 
My media are sketches (doodling), 3D animation, net-art and video.
12/8/19, 21:09 - Marco: Wow
12/8/19, 21:09 - Marco: Really nice

1/5/20, 16:54 - Lorenzo: Sorry..
1/5/20, 16:55 - Marco: Makes me remember that mine is not a sturdy, solid piece of furniture i made in the kabk workshops
1/5/20, 16:55 - Marco: Which probably means I'm gonna fail the course
1/5/20, 16:56 - Lorenzo: I only wanted to remind you about that it doesn't have to move
1/5/20, 16:56 - Marco: Oh yeah
1/5/20, 16:56 - Marco: Thank you for that

1/5/20, 17:41 - Marco: Yeah I mean
1/5/20, 17:41 - Marco: My main concern is that I should have started my laughing furniture before but I left it for christmas because I managed my time very badly
1/5/20, 17:41 - Marco: But at the same time, it's because every tuesday I got myself very busy with the IST
1/5/20, 17:42 - Marco: I'm just a but worried of which one of this two things (my bad time management or the fact that I still worked on school and not just wasted time) they are gonna care about more
1/5/20, 17:43 - Marco: Cause they would be right if they said it was my responsibility to have something built before christmas
1/5/20, 17:43 - Marco: It was my fault for not having it done before, so idk if they are gonna take my health condition as an excuse or smth
1/5/20, 17:43 - Marco: Are you sick btw?
1/5/20, 17:44 - Marco: And can I send you the thing I've done? the furniture. Still gonna have to add something but I have the 3d rendering
1/5/20, 17:44 - Marco: It's a "laughing stove and pot"
1/5/20, 17:52 - Lorenzo: true I don't know the right answer haha

1/11/20, 12:03 - Lorenzo: I want a bit of feedback about my added info for writing
1/11/20, 12:04 - Lorenzo: _The Shaman has told me that his grandfather once saw a rock in the shape of a hoof. He thought that this was a warning. Because in their culture, rocks with the shape of another thing mean that there is a power shift going on. 

This might be a sign. Are they coming for us? Are they already here? Are they living among the regular bisons? Or have they taken a human shape? Are they in the ruling force or did they start a cult? who knows, all I know is this can not be a coincidence _
1/11/20, 12:06 - Marco: Sounds good, gives context
1/11/20, 12:06 - Lorenzo: it's what I was missing right?

1/19/20, 18:16 - Marco: Can imagine
1/19/20, 18:16 - Marco: Nice for the process books
1/19/20, 18:17 - Marco: I have too much stuff to present in 10 mins I think
1/19/20, 18:17 - Marco: Especially if I wanna make process books
1/19/20, 18:17 - Marco: How much time do we have total?
1/19/20, 18:17 - Lorenzo: idk
1/19/20, 18:17 - Lorenzo: I just show it for the sake of hey I did sumthing and I own it
1/19/20, 18:18 - Marco: Yeah good one
1/19/20, 18:18 - Marco: 20 mins
1/19/20, 18:18 - Marco: means about 15 mins each
1/19/20, 18:18 - Marco: 10 for presentation and 5 for q&a
1/19/20, 18:18 - Marco: so i might talk for about 5-7 mins about my work and then invite them to take a walk around
1/19/20, 18:19 - Marco: So they can see what they want
1/19/20, 18:21 - Lorenzo: yeah
1/19/20, 18:22 - Lorenzo: Good afternoon and welcome to my collective presentation. 

Last collective I have received the feedback that I needed to grow conceptually and in the sense of my visual vocabulary and by presenting it I had the feedback that you wanted to see more of me in the presentation, be it the space and the works.  

I have in space for you 

A laughing ventilator and process

A video about a new found and exposed intergalactic species plus a document filled with my writing. 

A hypermedia desktop video essay about my views upon humour, comedy and satire plus a document that describes my previous and next project. 

A glimpse of an unknown and uncharted realm

A short film about a concrete desert made during my IST with process

And a statement towards the biggest supermarket of the Netherlands and a playable first version.  


In this semester I feel I have grown through the process. The laughing furniture is a sign of my analogue aesthetics and daring to work more with my hands and go crazy but also making important choices during the process and instead of thinking and doubting just go and do it. 

My conspiracy video is a take on how combining science, myths and footage out of context and into a theoretical visualization. The writing classes, assignments and exercises really got to me to put on paper what I want to say with for instance a work and more importantly to edit this until the clutter is gone. 


During the short classes of interactive narrative, I have also learned to work towards the element of what do I want to show and tell and am I telling this. 

The Hyper Media video is my take in the style of Kevin B Lee’s video essays about why I think humour is important.

Next semester I want to stay in this topic on whether can you joke about something. 
Because the connection between humour and opinion is free speech. And I’m wondering when is there a limitation. There are alot of people who have extreme thoughts about something that is not socially accepted. Who sets this boundary and defines on whether you may or may not think and talk about it. Discussion leaves to more understanding and disagreement, if someone doesn’t feel heard, it sets a tension and that is very applicable. 

So my next project is to interview people about whether they feel understood and heard . 

What I wanted to learn from my IST was to work more with Cinema 4D and After effects and getting to know the software and render settings. Getting more technical in this. 


For next semester: I would like to get even more familiar with Zbrush because I didn’t feel the need to use it in this project.
1/19/20, 18:22 - Lorenzo: this isn't final but I just wanted to write my points down

1/29/20, 21:59 - Marco: It was
1/29/20, 22:00 - Lorenzo: Wait explain
1/29/20, 22:01 - Lorenzo: It's always wrong to be that overexaggeratedly positive
1/29/20, 22:01 - Lorenzo: But we call it naive
1/29/20, 22:02 - Lorenzo: Because it was an assumption and the fact we had to tell him how the small dust particles work _even though you can't smell them_
1/29/20, 22:03 - Marco: Noo jeroen is not naive

2/3/20, 13:50 - Lorenzo: Dear people from I/M/D/,

I am a bit absent minded since last week.
This is because of my mother's current medical situation, it's a bit difficult to tell what's the matter because it's a "day-by-day let's see what's the matter before we can take steps" situation which uncertainty is mentally exhausting. I'm familiar with this kind of predicament. I kind of know how to deal with it yet It still is fucking difficult. As always I will try to be on schedule because it's a good distraction instead of laying on the couch and thinking how things could go wrong and worse. 

If my study seems to get a bit because of this I will let you know. But to end it with a positive message, I'm sure this semester is going to be fun. 

See you in class!

Lorenzo
2/3/20, 13:50 - Lorenzo: A bit off*

2/17/20, 22:49 - Lorenzo: hahaha
2/17/20, 22:49 - Lorenzo: my dad just asked me to help in the garden over the holiday
2/17/20, 22:50 - Lorenzo: which is a nice garden
2/17/20, 22:50 - Lorenzo: and that got me thinking
2/17/20, 22:51 - Lorenzo: the kabk garden project should have been co-designed with actual gardener / horticulturalists to make it more of a garden and less of a green crate parking lot
2/17/20, 23:13 - Marco: Hahahaha
2/18/20, 08:34 - Lorenzo: https://youtu.be/JT4tUuWRW_k
2/18/20, 14:30 - Marco: Where u at
2/18/20, 18:42 - Lorenzo: that convo with Anna really was nice
2/18/20, 19:09 - Marco: Today was nice in general
2/18/20, 19:17 - Lorenzo: I agree but I really needed to get some stuff of my chest and Anna was sweet as always
2/18/20, 19:37 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
2/18/20, 19:58 - Marco: Hahahahahahah
2/19/20, 09:36 - Lorenzo: I don't know how to motivate something like this
2/19/20, 09:36 - Lorenzo: but I wish you the best of luck in your retreat
2/19/20, 09:48 - Marco: Thx bud
2/19/20, 09:51 - Lorenzo: I slept reaally gooood
2/19/20, 10:09 - Marco: Same
2/19/20, 10:13 - Lorenzo: Also this morning sun
2/19/20, 10:13 - Lorenzo: Starting my IST at 11
3/1/20, 13:06 - Marco: Waddup how are you
3/1/20, 13:06 - Lorenzo: He has risen
3/1/20, 13:07 - Marco: He did do though
3/1/20, 13:16 - Lorenzo: heth hadth haveth thoughth
3/1/20, 13:18 - Marco: So did I miss anything
3/1/20, 13:19 - Lorenzo: lemmesee
3/1/20, 13:19 - Lorenzo: on which days weren't u there
3/1/20, 13:19 - Lorenzo: thursday and friday?
3/1/20, 13:20 - Lorenzo: thursday we had the entire day of touch designer introduction, that was nice
3/1/20, 13:21 - Lorenzo: friday we listened to eachother compositions, do stuff in ableton ( I need to get the notes from someone else bc my mind wasn't in kabk mode and already took the train home yet there I was )
3/1/20, 13:21 - Marco: Damn
3/1/20, 13:21 - Marco: What about after school
3/1/20, 13:22 - Lorenzo: you mean my life?
3/1/20, 13:22 - Marco: Jaman
3/1/20, 13:22 - Lorenzo: eeehm I spent the first half of the holiday resting on a dub party and mostly resting
Went out for dinner on Monday, ehm
3/1/20, 13:22 - Lorenzo: my mom is back home since friday
3/1/20, 13:23 - Lorenzo: I went to some bars on friday and yesterday to a reggae / dancehall / dub party which was different bc it was a lot of old roots dub and dancehall, good vibes
3/1/20, 13:25 - Lorenzo: oh and my dr martens sole on the left foot is kapot and I went to the shoemaker, he said that he could fix it for free with new stuff but my shoe was still too wet on the inside so yesterday I went there like alright free repair or else I could throw away and then he was offended because he had a business to run and I had to pay 25 euros if I wanted to get it done, I was like that would have been nice to know on Thursday
3/1/20, 13:26 - Lorenzo: because to spend 25 euros on repairing a sole with the uncertainty that it will fail is not really fair game to repair cost
3/1/20, 13:26 - Marco: Great to hear
3/1/20, 13:27 - Lorenzo: I understand him but I could get firm working shoes for 25 instead of a crippled doc martens and then just start saving for new ones haha
3/1/20, 13:27 - Lorenzo: oh and I bought a festival ticket
3/1/20, 13:27 - Marco: You can probably even get dr martens for 25 euros
3/1/20, 13:28 - Lorenzo: which means my perspective has expanded to longer term in a good way
3/1/20, 13:28 - Marco: Haha aight
3/1/20, 13:28 - Marco: Ok gotta call my mom sorry
3/1/20, 13:28 - Lorenzo: true but vegan leather lasts long than the animal leather (I had these babies for 4 years)
3/1/20, 13:28 - Marco: Never hear something like vegan leather haha
3/1/20, 13:29 - Marco: But sure you can find smth
3/1/20, 13:29 - Marco: But now gotta leave for more 10 days to call my motha
3/1/20, 13:32 - Lorenzo: Hahaha I kind of get tit
3/1/20, 17:06 - Marco: Oh I'm happy for you
3/1/20, 17:06 - Marco: That you get tit
3/1/20, 17:06 - Marco: Not everyone does
3/1/20, 17:06 - Lorenzo: I don't :(
3/1/20, 17:06 - Marco: But you're lucky
3/1/20, 17:06 - Marco: A tit getter
3/1/20, 17:06 - Lorenzo: it was a typo :(
3/1/20, 17:06 - Marco: yeah i get tit
3/1/20, 17:06 - Lorenzo: i wan em titty :(
3/1/20, 17:10 - Marco: i feel u
3/1/20, 17:12 - Lorenzo: get ur hands off me u perv >:[
3/1/20, 17:13 - Lorenzo: oh and I had some selfreflection this week
3/1/20, 17:16 - Lorenzo: I was watching this series about kids who had problems while going to school and walking off the path 
and there was one guy who was exploding because of his own frustrations and that in his direct environment people were complaining, acting like morons and he's like I GOT MY OWN CROSS TO BEAR I dont need this slacking off negativity

I felt that cause I was tired and overworked
3/1/20, 17:16 - Lorenzo: (note: I am not relating to the kids situation being astray but to his current mood then haha)
3/1/20, 17:25 - Marco: Nice
3/1/20, 17:25 - Marco: My course was very intense and I'm gonna tell you
3/1/20, 17:25 - Marco: I feel like it really changed my way of thinking (for the better) even though I have to practice quite a lot
3/1/20, 17:26 - Marco: Not gonna become jeroen 2 though
3/1/20, 17:26 - Marco: don't worry
3/1/20, 17:26 - Lorenzo: hahaha I have a very easy strategy
3/1/20, 17:26 - Lorenzo: if that happens
3/1/20, 17:26 - Lorenzo: also you change for yourself not for others :)
3/1/20, 17:27 - Lorenzo: I'm charged up to handle our class and things agan
3/1/20, 17:27 - Marco: bUt YoU jUsT hAvE tO bE pOsItIvE
3/1/20, 17:27 - Marco: no ofc
3/1/20, 17:28 - Lorenzo: haha change the word positive for distant and that's my view :P
3/1/20, 17:28 - Marco: The funny thing is that this sentence is completely in opposition with the message of the meditation technique
3/1/20, 17:29 - Marco: but yeah jeroen is not too bad
3/1/20, 17:29 - Lorenzo: Can I say that there's too much energy, time and mentioning going on in his name
3/1/20, 17:29 - Marco: In general i feel like I can appreciate everyone way more
3/1/20, 17:30 - Lorenzo: good
3/1/20, 17:30 - Marco: Even wies
3/1/20, 17:30 - Marco: I really changed my attitude on her
3/1/20, 17:30 - Lorenzo: that is true
3/1/20, 17:30 - Marco: How do you know hah
3/1/20, 17:31 - Lorenzo: I'm talking in general
3/1/20, 17:31 - Lorenzo: for myself
3/1/20, 17:31 - Marco: It happened during the thing
3/1/20, 17:31 - Lorenzo: the thing that I said bout
3/1/20, 17:32 - Lorenzo: even though I got frustrated on her 
my mind refreshes any time I enter KABK and if I talk to Wies it's mostly alright
3/1/20, 17:33 - Lorenzo: in the end we're colleagues right
3/1/20, 17:33 - Marco: Yeah but also apart from what the meditation did for me in that regard
3/1/20, 17:33 - Marco: I also had a major realization on her
3/1/20, 17:33 - Marco: Quite sad realization but that's my view
3/1/20, 17:33 - Marco: Maybe it's not even the truth but it makes sense to me
3/1/20, 17:33 - Marco: And it is that
3/1/20, 17:34 - Marco: Actually idk if you care hhaa
3/1/20, 17:34 - Marco: I think I'm the only one who could care about something like this
3/1/20, 17:34 - Lorenzo: well you better come with the conclusion
3/1/20, 17:35 - Lorenzo: because else I paused the thing I was watching for hesitation and I don't like that hahaha
3/1/20, 17:35 - Marco: well the conclusion of it is that she is suffering a lot for the loss of her brother and she is seeking other people to have the same attitude with (and she talked to me often about how she behaved with her brother)
3/1/20, 17:36 - Marco: She told me that she was very very bonded to him
3/1/20, 17:36 - Marco: but at his funeral she didnt even cry
3/1/20, 17:36 - Marco: so she definitely kept that suffering inside and she is not letting it out
3/1/20, 17:36 - Lorenzo: yeah I understand
3/1/20, 17:36 - Marco: and as she explained it it was the same exact attitude she had with me and she is having with roberto
3/1/20, 17:37 - Lorenzo: but at the same time she is a 20something and she has a storm inside and she tries to work with it 
in the end it's her responsibility to take the steps to a psyche or what
3/1/20, 17:37 - Marco: And I'm grateful I came to terms with this after the meditation because if I had thought of this earlier it would have crushed me
3/1/20, 17:37 - Marco: Of course
3/1/20, 17:37 - Lorenzo: you know what I kinda also don't like about our class?
3/1/20, 17:38 - Marco: That's also why I don't feel any hate towards her now
3/1/20, 17:38 - Marco: Hahah *rolls down list*
3/1/20, 17:42 - Lorenzo: Well it's the audacity of people taking positions and steps to and for others 
going too deep in some places where there was no consent given and that I believe is where the friction is
There are people more closed towards class than others and I don't think that is necessarily for wrong reasons and I think that is fine, if people really don't want to join in certain events or decisions.
3/1/20, 17:43 - Lorenzo: I think there should be a mutual respect between the big group initiatives and the people that don't want in
3/1/20, 17:43 - Lorenzo: be it the introvert extrovert relation
3/1/20, 17:44 - Lorenzo: And to close this thing for myself: I also think the lack of discipline is a problem
3/1/20, 17:44 - Marco: That's one thing I learned very much and well in this 10 days :)
3/1/20, 17:44 - Marco: very proud
3/1/20, 17:45 - Marco: Woke up at 4.00 am with a smile on my face
3/1/20, 17:45 - Marco: Couldn't believe myself
3/1/20, 17:45 - Marco: Went to bed with no dinner, no craving for it at all
3/1/20, 17:45 - Marco: And the amount of food I hate before at dinner was i n s a n e
3/1/20, 17:45 - Marco: Not human trust me
3/1/20, 17:45 - Marco: This technique is really da shit man
3/1/20, 17:46 - Lorenzo: as long as you don't become dogmatic about it I'm listening
3/1/20, 17:46 - Marco: I prefer to explain in person
3/1/20, 17:46 - Marco: It is quite long
3/1/20, 17:46 - Marco: I can explain you at lunch tomorro
3/1/20, 17:46 - Marco: It's not dogmatic at all because you experience everything first hand
3/1/20, 17:47 - Lorenzo: haha
3/1/20, 17:47 - Lorenzo: I understand
3/1/20, 17:47 - Marco: And I don't know how much you know about Vipassana
3/1/20, 17:47 - Marco: But it is possibly the least dogmatic serious meditation technique
3/1/20, 17:47 - Marco: The premise is that literally everyone can practice it
3/1/20, 17:47 - Marco: It is not religious
3/1/20, 17:48 - Marco: It doesn't ask you to accept anything that you don't actually experience yourself
3/1/20, 17:48 - Marco: And everything is scientific and rational and makes perfect sense
3/1/20, 17:48 - Marco: Because it is so simple and straightforward
3/1/20, 17:48 - Marco: It's really crazy, I'm gonna tell you tomorrow if you want
3/1/20, 17:48 - Marco: Now gotta catch up with 10 days of work
3/1/20, 17:48 - Lorenzo: Well yeah that is because it's a buddhist branch
3/1/20, 17:49 - Marco: Yeah
3/1/20, 17:49 - Marco: I didn't even know it before joining it
3/1/20, 17:49 - Lorenzo: And yes I have done research
3/1/20, 17:49 - Marco: I didn't almost know anything about it
3/1/20, 17:49 - Lorenzo: and yes I know about the principles and that kind of stuff
3/1/20, 17:49 - Marco: Yeah the principles are possibly the least important thing
3/1/20, 17:49 - Lorenzo: let me finish
3/1/20, 17:50 - Lorenzo: have you learned nothing ❤
3/1/20, 17:50 - Marco: hahahah
3/1/20, 17:50 - Marco: The "typing..." thing is very flashy
3/1/20, 17:50 - Lorenzo: because retreat in buddhist traditional values / principles mostly comes down to getting rid of the desire 
waking up early, limiting yourself to go inside
3/1/20, 17:51 - Lorenzo: And structure
3/1/20, 17:51 - Marco: ye
3/1/20, 17:51 - Lorenzo: I have the intro course to zen meditation for a half year
3/1/20, 17:51 - Lorenzo: done*
3/1/20, 17:52 - Lorenzo: and I have a book by this zen master talking about how (zen)buddhist rituals are being practiced and helping in burnout culture
3/1/20, 17:52 - Lorenzo: but that is also an adaptation
3/1/20, 17:53 - Lorenzo: Extremist Buddhists do exist and that's something to look in to
3/1/20, 17:53 - Lorenzo: haha I never told you this btw
3/1/20, 17:54 - Marco: yeah i know they do
3/1/20, 17:54 - Marco: i will
3/1/20, 17:54 - Lorenzo: but I even went to see the Dalai Lama 7years ago
3/1/20, 17:54 - Lorenzo: he was in Rotterdam
3/1/20, 17:54 - Marco: Haha wow
3/1/20, 17:54 - Marco: like, a conference?
3/1/20, 17:54 - Lorenzo: yes
3/1/20, 17:54 - Lorenzo: it was a reading
3/1/20, 17:55 - Lorenzo: or like lecture
3/1/20, 17:55 - Marco: He is a very controversial person afaik
3/1/20, 17:55 - Lorenzo: Well yeah
3/1/20, 17:55 - Lorenzo: China / Tibet 
Dalai Lama 
Captivity of the follower
3/1/20, 17:56 - Lorenzo: several subgenres of buddhism
3/1/20, 17:56 - Lorenzo: these are all very very grey areas
3/1/20, 17:56 - Marco: Yeah I learned about it
3/1/20, 17:56 - Marco: but vipassana is the pure storic buddhism
3/1/20, 17:56 - Marco: Straight from the buddha
3/1/20, 17:56 - Marco: g o double t
3/1/20, 17:57 - Lorenzo: Der ÜberBuddhism
3/1/20, 17:57 - Marco: ja man
3/1/20, 17:57 - Marco: but yeah in the course they said something about these "polluted" dirty versions of buddhism
3/1/20, 17:57 - Marco: so I'm very grateful I came to know this one
3/1/20, 17:57 - Marco: the message is wholesome and I really did feel it
3/1/20, 17:58 - Marco: in direct experience
3/1/20, 17:58 - Marco: it is just really cheesy to say but
3/1/20, 17:58 - Marco: I felt really really full of love at the end of the course
3/1/20, 17:58 - Marco: That is just how it was
3/1/20, 17:58 - Marco: I was literally radiating
3/1/20, 17:58 - Lorenzo: Can I be that dick?
3/1/20, 17:58 - Marco: But I can also imagine that this is not what everyone is looking for
3/1/20, 17:58 - Marco: yeah I'll love you anyway
3/1/20, 17:59 - Marco: ;)
3/1/20, 18:02 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
3/1/20, 18:06 - Marco: with pure I only mean that it comes straight from him as far as it is historically researched
3/1/20, 18:06 - Marco: That's all I mean
3/1/20, 18:06 - Marco: And the course himself has a couple dark sides for sure
3/1/20, 18:06 - Lorenzo: aaahhh
3/1/20, 18:07 - Marco: But the technique itself, as far as I experienced it
3/1/20, 18:07 - Marco: And as far as many experience it
3/1/20, 18:07 - Marco: Is just direct tangible positive experience
3/1/20, 18:07 - Lorenzo: I understand ]
3/1/20, 18:07 - Marco: But you have to work hard for it (just like real life)
3/1/20, 18:07 - Marco: And it purely depends on you
3/1/20, 18:08 - Lorenzo: isn't that the case for everything you do
3/1/20, 18:08 - Lorenzo: ever
3/1/20, 18:08 - Marco: And having struggled with depression a lot I like that I finally can see someone in myself I can rely on
3/1/20, 18:08 - Marco: Exactly
3/1/20, 18:08 - Marco: But it depends entirely only on how disciplined and equanimous you are about the experience
3/1/20, 18:09 - Marco: And even though
3/1/20, 18:09 - Marco: In 10 days it changed my attitude and self-discipline 180 degrees
3/1/20, 18:09 - Marco: So for a while I'm gonna keep practicing it and maybe one day I'll realize I don't need it anymore
3/1/20, 18:09 - Marco: I am not looking for enlightment or complete purity (which is the true goal of Vipassana)
3/1/20, 18:10 - Lorenzo: yeah
3/1/20, 18:10 - Lorenzo: alright
3/1/20, 18:10 - Marco: But just for enough happiness to live haha
3/1/20, 18:10 - Marco: so ja
3/1/20, 18:10 - Marco: one more thing before i let you go
3/1/20, 18:10 - Marco: i can't remember what we were to do for tuesday's thing
3/1/20, 18:10 - Lorenzo: ahahahha
3/1/20, 18:11 - Lorenzo: SELF DISCIPLINE AND INSIGHT AND GOALS AND PRACTICE AND what were we supposed to do again
3/1/20, 18:11 - Lorenzo: joke
3/1/20, 18:11 - Lorenzo: ehm well
3/1/20, 18:12 - Marco: hahahahaha
3/1/20, 18:12 - Lorenzo: we all did some research and we're supposed to present it on Tuesday
3/1/20, 18:12 - Marco: i just forgot
3/1/20, 18:12 - Marco: oh ok
3/1/20, 18:12 - Marco: how
3/1/20, 18:13 - Lorenzo: *this is what they want in the presentation*

Please say something about:

1.

Which logo / company did you choose?

2.

What does this company stand for? What is their pitch / abstract?

Show this on the website of the company. The splash page always shows the essence of what the company stands for, and also how it visually represents itself.

What qualities do they measure themselves?

Which dark or controversial matters are connected to the company?

How does the company manifest itself in the media, and what opposition has developed to the company's activities?

3.

Can you give an analysis of the design of the company logo, and can you say something about the evolution of the logo?

That also means: the evolution of the logo runs parallel with the evolution of the company, and the development of graphic (business) design.

How does the company represent itself? Which stories / propaganda does the company use?

4.

How do you continue now?

Are you going to search for material first, or do you already have a definitive choice of materials?

Or do you let yourself be surprised by what you think, to put the object together based on that surprise?

5.

Can you say something about the spatial quality of the logo object?

Show your first sketches, and tell more about the first iterations.

6.

What is your agenda for the coming weeks up to the next collective presentation?
3/1/20, 18:14 - Marco: oh yeah but we have to do it individually or as a group
3/1/20, 18:17 - Lorenzo: will be fine
3/1/20, 18:18 - Marco: look at him taking all the merit
3/1/20, 18:18 - Marco: hahahah
3/1/20, 18:18 - Marco: if i didnt pose the question in the first place
3/1/20, 18:18 - Lorenzo: well I was thinking about it today
3/1/20, 18:18 - Marco: the poem would not have flowed like a river out of the creek of your inspiration
3/1/20, 18:18 - Marco: ooh yeha
3/1/20, 18:18 - Marco: but I thought it first
3/1/20, 18:18 - Marco: yesterday

3/1/20, 18:19 - Marco: hahahahahah
3/1/20, 18:20 - Lorenzo: no but I felt like I didn't take enough effort or like control in a group last few times
3/1/20, 18:20 - Lorenzo: so I wanted this time to be more energetic
3/1/20, 18:21 - Marco: got it
3/1/20, 18:21 - Lorenzo: I felt like an intern at the last burst
3/1/20, 18:21 - Marco: I also take a lot of control in group situations and I'm bad at avoiding it
3/1/20, 18:21 - Marco: So I'm sorry if it made you feel bad
3/1/20, 18:22 - Lorenzo: not if I make myself feel bad first
3/1/20, 18:22 - Marco: Yeah but I just do it naturally I don't know why
3/1/20, 18:23 - Marco: Not that i don't like it, but if you felt like I put you down or something don't think it's personal or smth
3/1/20, 18:23 - Marco: I will mind it more next time, I know it irritates many people
3/1/20, 18:23 - Lorenzo: well no
3/1/20, 18:23 - Lorenzo: I just thought the entire thing and making and produce sucked

3/2/20, 20:30 - Lorenzo: Using fear as a hype to sell crap and profit from it
3/2/20, 20:31 - Lorenzo: I'm thinking of narrowing it down from holisic to pseudoscience
3/2/20, 20:31 - Lorenzo: which is a differnece
3/2/20, 20:31 - Marco: I mean for every of this epidemics there is the speculation of someone profiting out of the general chaos

3/3/20, 20:15 - Marco: Haha i think personally it goes beyond that
3/3/20, 20:16 - Lorenzo: it also has that Massive Attack  -  Blue Lines  album vibe
3/3/20, 20:16 - Marco: Yeah more like it
3/3/20, 20:16 - Marco: I love how they use the voice and the lyrics in a way that really is aimed to irritate the average italin
3/3/20, 20:16 - Marco: Like provoking
3/3/20, 20:17 - Lorenzo: but Mano Negra also, they also had these kinds of sounds
3/3/20, 20:17 - Marco: They are like "if you are so nationalist and you know your history so well then you also know the color of the blood that flows in your veins"
3/3/20, 20:17 - Marco: Get me some songs like it
3/3/20, 20:19 - Lorenzo: give me some time over the coming time

3/4/20, 21:15 - Marco: I am very relaxed
3/4/20, 21:15 - Marco: Despite everything going the opposite as it should
3/4/20, 21:34 - Lorenzo: keep calm
3/4/20, 21:34 - Lorenzo: no end of world
3/4/20, 21:34 - Lorenzo: world still here
3/4/20, 21:34 - Lorenzo: you still here
3/4/20, 21:34 - Lorenzo: passing shall this too
3/4/20, 21:35 - Marco: Probably
3/4/20, 21:35 - Lorenzo: *marco's voice* : _Come onnn_
3/4/20, 21:35 - Marco: But I'm starting to doubt if this is where I belong
3/4/20, 21:35 - Marco: I mean kabk
3/4/20, 21:36 - Marco: There is no reason valid enough for me to get constantly depressed everytime I have to get a new idea out of my head
3/4/20, 21:36 - Lorenzo: doubt is good and logical
3/4/20, 21:36 - Marco: For sure
3/4/20, 21:36 - Lorenzo: but mental breakdowns are part of studying anyhow
3/4/20, 21:36 - Marco: But this time I'm feeling very close to "sure" of what I am saying
3/4/20, 21:37 - Marco: Yeah but not sustainable so often
3/4/20, 21:37 - Marco: A study that drives me nuts like this is not a study that is wise continuing maybe
3/4/20, 21:37 - Lorenzo: well if this itch continues
3/4/20, 21:37 - Lorenzo: go to Anna, Janine, Mirjam
3/4/20, 21:37 - Marco: I have appointment with Mirijam
3/4/20, 21:38 - Marco: Monday
3/4/20, 21:38 - Lorenzo: Good :)
3/4/20, 21:38 - Marco: But for tomorrow I didnt manage to have an idea so i wrote to Sara
3/4/20, 21:38 - Marco: I'm gonna be there, will show the research and what I'm going through
3/4/20, 21:38 - Lorenzo: Can I say something, as in my thoughts
3/4/20, 21:38 - Marco: If she wants to hear
3/4/20, 21:38 - Marco: Not gonna risk my health on school anymore
3/4/20, 21:39 - Marco: I have to learn to say stop before it's too late
3/4/20, 21:39 - Marco: Yes
3/4/20, 21:40 - Lorenzo: I recognize alot of your things / struggles  from my first first year and one of the problems was
3/4/20, 21:41 - Lorenzo: This is not KABK, this is your own way of working with KABK. 
You don't grant yourself the balance of rest and you have huge ambitions yet these things are what's sucking your energy.
3/4/20, 21:42 - Lorenzo: And also you were very stressed about if you were going to pass or not
3/4/20, 21:43 - Lorenzo: I think you use more energy than you are allowing yourself to recharge
3/4/20, 21:43 - Lorenzo: (note: this is what I see)
3/4/20, 21:43 - Lorenzo: /end of message
3/4/20, 21:43 - Lorenzo: gaga
3/4/20, 21:45 - Lorenzo: `haha*
3/4/20, 21:45 - Marco: I understand your point of you, but I'll tell you openheartedly
3/4/20, 21:46 - Marco: First time I'm being honest to someone else (as well as to myself) about this
3/4/20, 21:47 - Marco: I know it is not KABK at all, KABK is a great school and I love basically everything about it and about how it works and what goes on in there. But liking something doesn't equal being good at it, and  more and more I'm having the confirmation that I am not fit for this school
3/4/20, 21:48 - Marco: I don't doubt that I have good technical capabilities
3/4/20, 21:48 - Marco: I acknowledge that and am very proud of it
3/4/20, 21:48 - Marco: But this is not what this school looks for
3/4/20, 21:48 - Marco: And to be honest I really don't understand sometimes why did they accept me in there
3/4/20, 21:49 - Lorenzo: NO BODY DOES
3/4/20, 21:49 - Lorenzo: sorry
3/4/20, 21:49 - Lorenzo: continue
3/4/20, 21:49 - Marco: I'll elaborate
3/4/20, 21:49 - Marco: When I see everyone else in that school
3/4/20, 21:50 - Marco: Since the first day of the first year, I see that everyone has (even if really faint and not evident sometimes) a general direction or scope of interest
3/4/20, 21:50 - Marco: And their style and the things that they do moves along that invisible line
3/4/20, 21:50 - Marco: Until (4th year) hopefully that scope tightens until one has a quite distinct style and aim of what he's all about
3/4/20, 21:51 - Marco: Even if they don't have any technical capability at all
3/4/20, 21:52 - Marco: For me since the start it was the other way round, I started having a very good technical knowledge of very complex things, and preferred a style that is very aestethically clean and polished and designy
3/4/20, 21:52 - Marco: Which is the total opposite, and I even kinda knew that before joining, more the first thing out of the two
3/4/20, 21:52 - Lorenzo: Well
3/4/20, 21:52 - Marco: And I hoped since the start to find my own voice
3/4/20, 21:53 - Marco: But I cannot
3/4/20, 21:53 - Marco: I have a fuckload of interest
3/4/20, 21:53 - Marco: Interests
3/4/20, 21:53 - Marco: But dont commit to anything
3/4/20, 21:53 - Marco: I favor aesthetically pleasing results to meaningful ones
3/4/20, 21:53 - Lorenzo: also this is very common
3/4/20, 21:53 - Marco: Make an example
3/4/20, 21:53 - Marco: If you have any
3/4/20, 21:54 - Marco: And keep in mind that I am not like crying or whining about these things rn haha
3/4/20, 21:54 - Lorenzo: Aesthetically pleasing and meaningful are all related to what the maker wants to show
3/4/20, 21:54 - Marco: Compared to other times, I'm analyzing them with a very (I think) objective eye, I am not being invested emotionally
3/4/20, 21:55 - Lorenzo: Well I think you are alot of times being very definitive
3/4/20, 21:55 - Marco: Definitive?
3/4/20, 21:55 - Lorenzo: concluding alot of stuff
3/4/20, 21:55 - Marco: As in work
3/4/20, 21:55 - Marco: Or just as in jumping to conclusions
3/4/20, 21:55 - Lorenzo: asin not keeping stuff open
3/4/20, 21:56 - Marco: Yeah I cannot seem to avoid this and many other habits that normally an artist does not have
3/4/20, 21:56 - Lorenzo: you're not playing
3/4/20, 21:56 - Lorenzo: and that's the struggle I think
3/4/20, 21:56 - Marco: I can't seem to understand how to do that, sometimes it seems like my brain is wired this way
3/4/20, 21:57 - Marco: And it takes a lot of time to change something like this if I want to
3/4/20, 21:57 - Lorenzo: Well I have something to ee about this and:
3/4/20, 21:57 - Lorenzo: coming into school not feeling in place
3/4/20, 21:57 - Lorenzo: say*
3/4/20, 21:57 - Marco: Sorry for burping all of this stuff on you haha
3/4/20, 21:58 - Marco: If it's more than you can handle be honest, I can deal with it myself I think
3/4/20, 21:58 - Lorenzo: stfu
3/4/20, 21:58 - Marco: Haha thanks
3/4/20, 21:58 - Marco: You know I'd do the same
3/4/20, 22:03 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
3/4/20, 22:15 - Marco: Yeah but the problem is when this "moment" happens everytime I need to think of an idea, it got as far as feeling it go down and getting terrified whenever I know that I have to start thinking about an idea soon
3/4/20, 22:15 - Marco: And that may be, as you said, because I try to look for the definitive thing rather than building brick by brick
3/4/20, 22:15 - Marco: But I have two remarks about this
3/4/20, 22:17 - Marco: 1. This was already clear before I was admitted from my portfolio, which is why I do not understand sometimes why they got me in
2. This is an attitude that I have to everything in life but I had it for so long that I cannot change it from night to day, it needs focus and persistence and dedication and time for whenever slip-ups occur and that is not possible with all the deadlines and shit
3/4/20, 22:18 - Marco: And I have no idea how I got this far with such a wrong approach to the practice
3/4/20, 22:18 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
3/4/20, 22:18 - Lorenzo: go on
3/4/20, 22:19 - Marco: I did the first year very very badly, basically wasted it to run behind wies and Roberto and I'm not giving them any responsability at all, I take full responsibility of that cause simply I didnt know any better
3/4/20, 22:20 - Marco: I have learned a lot from it and grew up incredibly as a person as a result, but not as an artist cause in the end I still wasted the first year, that is crucial to experiment in a less serious way
3/4/20, 22:20 - Lorenzo: I completely understand
3/4/20, 22:20 - Marco: And find your path more comfortably, you are actually encouraged to do that
3/4/20, 22:21 - Marco: But now i wasted that chance and I wandered for too long in a place that I don't know well, and I have lost the path (sorry for sounding cheesy)
3/4/20, 22:21 - Marco: And I constantly feel very slow and behind everyone else, and I cannot go too slow on a highway
3/4/20, 22:22 - Lorenzo: I'm glad you are letting the noise out
3/4/20, 22:22 - Marco: Otherwise others risk because of me
3/4/20, 22:22 - Marco: And I do that all the time, taking my frustration out on others
3/4/20, 22:22 - Marco: 5 minutes into an idea, i already ask others and tell them I can't figure out something
3/4/20, 22:22 - Marco: Hoping that they can give me a lead
3/4/20, 22:22 - Lorenzo: Alright I now feel I like I'm tired.
3/4/20, 22:23 - Lorenzo: I'd still encourage you to also talk to anna and janine and perhaps even dave
3/4/20, 22:24 - Marco: I will talk to everyone is needed
3/4/20, 22:24 - Marco: Thanks for listening
3/4/20, 22:24 - Marco: Helped a lot
3/4/20, 22:25 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
3/4/20, 22:26 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
3/4/20, 22:27 - Marco: Yes but not so emotionally involved
3/4/20, 22:27 - Lorenzo: ?
3/4/20, 22:27 - Lorenzo: what do you mean
3/4/20, 22:27 - Marco: <Media omitted>
3/4/20, 22:28 - Lorenzo: I didn't base the fucking drawings on you :')
3/4/20, 22:29 - Marco: Oh but there is some of my sentences
3/4/20, 22:29 - Lorenzo: you don't own sentences hahaha
3/4/20, 22:30 - Marco: So that's how you felt back then?
3/4/20, 22:30 - Lorenzo: the red drawing is based on feelings I have every now and then
3/4/20, 22:30 - Marco: Oh but man you are doing greay
3/4/20, 22:30 - Marco: Great
3/4/20, 22:30 - Lorenzo: I based it on the text I wrote a
3/4/20, 22:30 - Lorenzo: minute before that
3/4/20, 22:31 - Marco: Like you're getting brilliant stuff out of that head everyday
3/4/20, 22:31 - Lorenzo: The red drawing is about my insecurity / lack of trust / not feeling 'love'
3/4/20, 22:31 - Marco: I remember to be honest last year I thought of your stuff that it was 1/10000 of what it is now, it got so incredibly good it doesnt belong to that school almost haha
3/4/20, 22:32 - Lorenzo: the green one isn't emotionally drive at all
3/4/20, 22:32 - Marco: Understandable, but this is what i think of now
3/4/20, 22:32 - Marco: Your growth was exponential
3/4/20, 22:32 - Marco: Sometimes it is really genius
3/4/20, 22:32 - Lorenzo: also yeah my things are exceeding the art norms of johan
3/4/20, 22:32 - Lorenzo: because I found my things now
3/4/20, 22:32 - Marco: Johan dont know shit
3/4/20, 22:33 - Marco: Yeah I noticed
3/4/20, 22:33 - Lorenzo: I'm not struggling at all but I wanted to write / draw things
3/4/20, 22:33 - Lorenzo: that were part of my emotional struggles and my psyche that stress me every now and then
3/4/20, 22:34 - Marco: It comes and goes I guess
3/4/20, 22:34 - Marco: Can you recommend me something to watch to e n h a n c e my critical thinking
3/4/20, 22:35 - Lorenzo: you don't have to have the answer to a riddle I'm trying solve for and on my own
3/4/20, 22:35 - Lorenzo: I just wanted to show how I get rid of the noise in a creative way
3/4/20, 22:35 - Lorenzo: t o e n h a n ce
3/4/20, 22:35 - Marco: Yeah I cant do that, if my mental state could inspire me that would be amazing haha

3/12/20, 19:42 - Marco: ufff
3/12/20, 20:03 - Lorenzo: hmm
3/12/20, 20:16 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>

3/12/20, 20:49 - Lorenzo: it's a you wouldn't steal a car you won't steal videos
3/12/20, 20:49 - Lorenzo: but the aesthetics are so damn good
3/12/20, 20:49 - Marco: Very

3/13/20, 12:14 - Lorenzo: so how you feeling
3/13/20, 12:15 - Marco: Well it was the most important month of this year for me
3/13/20, 12:15 - Marco: So kinda "meh" but can't do anything about it
3/13/20, 12:15 - Lorenzo: you mean with the hospital, the corona
3/13/20, 12:15 - Lorenzo: and such
3/13/20, 12:16 - Marco: I mean that this month i had the spacesuit thing and the instrument thing
3/13/20, 12:16 - Lorenzo: oohh
3/13/20, 12:16 - Marco: But all cancelled
3/13/20, 12:16 - Lorenzo: yeah
3/13/20, 12:16 - Lorenzo: well you can't do much about it
3/13/20, 12:16 - Lorenzo: and it's not like you done a bad job
3/13/20, 12:16 - Marco: Yeah that's what I said
3/13/20, 12:16 - Marco: I didn't
3/13/20, 12:17 - Lorenzo: I had to cancel my birthday with family and postpone it to later
3/13/20, 12:17 - Marco: Weird times really
3/13/20, 12:17 - Lorenzo: yeah but people are going mental already
3/13/20, 12:17 - Lorenzo: WE NEED TO HOARD AT SUPERMARKETS
3/13/20, 12:18 - Lorenzo: there's no need to do that, there's no shortage, y'all been watching too much americanized series
3/13/20, 12:20 - Marco: There is also nothing you can do about that
3/13/20, 12:20 - Marco: As much as you can't do anything for coronavirus
3/13/20, 12:20 - Marco: People can't really be blamed for ignorance i think
3/13/20, 12:20 - Lorenzo: I'm just noting all the panic as well because I think it interesting
3/13/20, 12:20 - Lorenzo: it's*
3/13/20, 12:20 - Marco: Yeah it is very interesting
3/13/20, 12:21 - Lorenzo: because I can't really do much other stuff haha
3/13/20, 12:21 - Lorenzo: there are some dj friends who asked like
3/13/20, 12:22 - Lorenzo: 'is it ethical to do gigs under 99 people, it's not what I'm doing but just think it's an interesting topic'
3/13/20, 12:22 - Lorenzo: I mean I have slept so damn good last night xD
3/13/20, 12:22 - Lorenzo: because it also feels like some room to breathe and go internally a bit, might as well take benefit from it
3/13/20, 12:23 - Marco: Idk, personally I've been taking so many breaks I think it's time to start doing stuff but something always happens lol
3/13/20, 12:24 - Marco: <Media omitted>
3/13/20, 12:24 - Lorenzo: true
3/13/20, 12:24 - Marco: And they put an option in the app for "contactless delivery"
3/13/20, 12:24 - Lorenzo: is it mean to say that this is the least people should worry about?
3/13/20, 12:25 - Marco: It's not mean but makes little sense, there is no caution measure that has more relevance than another
3/13/20, 12:25 - Marco: Anything you can do is equally important
3/13/20, 12:25 - Marco: In your ordinary life
3/13/20, 12:27 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
3/13/20, 12:28 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
3/13/20, 12:29 - Marco: Yeah I didn't get your point tbh haha
3/13/20, 12:29 - Marco: Thuisbezorgd is a necessity for many more people than you think
3/13/20, 12:29 - Marco: I can tell you that more than half of the people that order are not rich mofos
3/13/20, 12:30 - Marco: Also
3/13/20, 12:30 - Lorenzo: I'm just talking from my point of view and financially
3/13/20, 12:30 - Lorenzo: and I'm aware of my wrongness

3/13/20, 12:59 - Marco: Not italian either
3/13/20, 13:11 - Lorenzo: I just spoke to my mother who was blabbering on about why my bday with family couldn't continue
3/13/20, 13:12 - Lorenzo: and I basically told her to shut up about it until further notice
3/13/20, 13:12 - Lorenzo: and also that one of the reasons I'm talking to that GP- shrink
3/13/20, 13:12 - Lorenzo: is because of the shitstorm of the last 6 years
3/13/20, 13:13 - Lorenzo: and that these things are trauma's now with some mental damage contained by the situation of my brother and mother and I'm just kinda done with coping with crap
3/13/20, 13:15 - Lorenzo: I'm just a bit fed up with my birthday which hasn't been the same for the last 6 years and I'm now acknowledging the fact that my brother's and mother's situation are shitty but I need to think and feel for myself
3/13/20, 13:16 - Lorenzo: and that these things combined with my love thing are the root of my depression together with some childhood things

3/13/20, 19:19 - Marco: There is a lot of uplifting that happened around the world during the outbreak that no one is talking about (understandably) because of the corona virus thing
3/13/20, 19:19 - Marco: Such as: australian bushfires have stopped
3/13/20, 19:19 - Marco: Or

3/19/20, 20:56 - Marco: Ye
3/19/20, 20:56 - Lorenzo: wanna talk about it?
3/19/20, 20:57 - Marco: Ja sure
3/19/20, 20:58 - Marco: My question was
3/19/20, 20:58 - Marco: I had others too but main was
3/19/20, 20:58 - Marco: That my recommendations for example take not only from my interests but also just what's popular/trending
3/19/20, 20:59 - Marco: And I was wondering if he tackled that, but that's really technical
3/19/20, 20:59 - Marco: on a more "ethical" standpoint, I was wondering what made him divide the "youtube population" in those categories, like what is the research that he conducted to get to these categorizations
3/19/20, 21:00 - Marco: And if it is not a bit reductive to just "call out" the conspiracists, the toddlers etc.
3/19/20, 21:01 - Lorenzo: I think it's more about examples in these cases
3/19/20, 21:01 - Lorenzo: answering to this
3/19/20, 21:02 - Lorenzo: well I guess he also wanted to talk about 'you are what you watch"
3/19/20, 21:03 - Marco: I mean I don't care about "micheal jackson's drummer performing smooth criminal' (actually popped up in my recommendations)
3/19/20, 21:04 - Marco: <Media omitted>

4/1/20, 10:57 - Lorenzo: What am I doing? 
I'm doing video essays about information in times of crisis.


Why am I doing this? 
There is alot going on, I'm talking about the Coronavirus of course. 
Everybody needs to remain indoors. 
But staying inside resolves in going online,
and let online be the area where there is alot of different info being shared. 
It's shared because of the message which people may like or agree with, 
but what is the goal of this content? 

And how do we distinguish this content?

What kinds of sources does this content provide?
and how does it affect us? 


What am I showing?
A series of content reviews and my stance on them. 

subjects:
- YouTube documentary by Janet Ossebaard
- Robert Jensen, Alex Jones
- Facebook story about a secret
- Fake medicine, televangelists, product placement, cures
- Fact checking websites 
- Anarchist websites
- Spherical cattle

4/4/20, 22:42 - Marco: “ 	I see the studio must be like a living thing, a life itself. The

machine must be live and intelligent. Then I put my mind into the machine and the machine perform reality. Invisible thought waves - you put them into the machine by sending them through the controls and the knobs or you jack it into the jack panel. The jack panel is the brain itself, so you got to patch up the brain and make the brain a living man, that the brain can take what you sending into it and live.

4/7/20, 13:41 - Marco: Hyper-reverberated Gibson
4/7/20, 13:41 - Marco: Generic catchy drum rythm
4/7/20, 13:41 - Marco: Overdriven voice
4/7/20, 13:41 - Marco: Sunset

4/7/20, 13:44 - Lorenzo: https://youtu.be/3WSk86uIx2E
4/7/20, 13:45 - Marco: Haha tabitha is the only name I would have giveth her
4/7/20, 13:50 - Marco: Face > Palm
4/7/20, 13:51 - Lorenzo: He traded in his moral talk for trying to be obscure in form of sharing his voice through easily enabletoned editing
4/7/20, 13:51 - Lorenzo: and therefore he gained a new level of vast pretentiousness
4/7/20, 13:52 - Marco: My god
4/7/20, 13:52 - Marco: This subtle striving for acknowledgement
4/7/20, 13:53 - Lorenzo: oh well
4/7/20, 13:53 - Lorenzo: damn
4/7/20, 13:53 - Lorenzo: dr seuss has made some awesome stuff :o
4/7/20, 13:53 - Marco: I don't think he did it either
4/7/20, 13:53 - Marco: I'm gonna look later
4/7/20, 13:54 - Lorenzo: I'm thinking of doing my new video essay over the beamer from the couch haha
4/7/20, 13:54 - Lorenzo: because I'm watching a 3 part documentary
4/7/20, 14:53 - Marco: Hahaha nice
4/7/20, 14:55 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
4/7/20, 16:49 - Marco: Pff
4/7/20, 16:50 - Lorenzo: are we with 15 in our class now? yeah right?
4/7/20, 16:50 - Marco: I really don't know haha
4/7/20, 16:50 - Marco: I respect your opinion about the break but I really don't get how anyone desperately needs a break
4/7/20, 16:50 - Marco: And I don't get melisa's point at all
4/7/20, 16:51 - Lorenzo: in the words of the big lebowski
4/7/20, 16:51 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
4/7/20, 16:52 - Marco: Yeah haha
4/7/20, 16:52 - Marco: Gotta rewatch it
4/7/20, 16:53 - Lorenzo: To me, the logic in the break is that we have been adapting to this situation (and I have been working kankerhard last week).
4/7/20, 16:54 - Lorenzo: It feels like I took a sprint
4/7/20, 16:54 - Lorenzo: and now am like empty haha
4/7/20, 16:59 - Marco: I understand
4/7/20, 17:00 - Marco: I still do not agree but I understand what you mean
4/7/20, 17:00 - Lorenzo: Hahaha well that's more for your own concern than mine
4/7/20, 17:00 - Marco: Ofc
4/7/20, 17:01 - Lorenzo: Okay I have done everything for the Adobe thing
4/7/20, 17:02 - Lorenzo: I emailed KABK IT for it
4/7/20, 17:02 - Lorenzo: and they said like
4/7/20, 17:05 - Lorenzo: "We don't have any agreement with Adobe concerning this offer, we can offer students an own temporary license but because of limited stock is this for students in financial need for the crisis. If you were planning on doing it you should do the Surfspot one (132 in one go instead of 20 a month = 240)"
4/7/20, 17:07 - Lorenzo: which is logical
4/7/20, 17:08 - Lorenzo: I think I'll do that because the payment of kabk is postponed
4/7/20, 17:36 - Marco: Yeah that would make sense
4/7/20, 17:36 - Marco: I'm also investing some of that monney
4/7/20, 18:22 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
4/7/20, 18:33 - Marco: ahahahaha

I hope you are doing well and find enough inspiration for some fake news sound design ;) >I think u workin
This friday is good friday, according to the semester schedule there's no school. > I have an agenda 
When it is up to me we will have a lesson this friday, since there's not so much else to do. > taking a stance 
Does everybody agree or is the agenda already full ? > Agree unless u have something better to do, not giving any other choice in answering
If we'll have a class we can use it to watch some more examples of documentary and sound, and I'm not going to give extra assignments for next week. > Trying to lure students
We will use the next week to finish all the older assignments so everybody is up to date. > See how sweet I am

The beer is filtered before packaging in bottles and kegs. As with many other Belgian beers, Kwak has a branded glass with its own distinctive shape.

4/15/20, 11:26 - Marco: Hihihi
4/15/20, 11:26 - Marco: Honest about what
4/15/20, 11:26 - Lorenzo: it is my honesty
4/15/20, 11:26 - Lorenzo: about wies' effort
4/15/20, 11:26 - Lorenzo: which I'm glad about
4/15/20, 11:27 - Lorenzo: because she's responding in time and putting in the group
4/15/20, 11:27 - Lorenzo: I'm not really in the mood to snap over every little gesture Jeroen makes, waste of my time and energy atm
4/15/20, 11:28 - Marco: Oooh
4/15/20, 11:28 - Marco: Meh, nothing remarkable to me
4/15/20, 11:29 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
4/15/20, 11:30 - Marco: She has always done this kinda things imo
4/15/20, 11:30 - Marco: not an opinion actually, a fact
4/15/20, 11:30 - Lorenzo: still I felt like giving her some credit
4/15/20, 11:31 - Marco: The opinion is that she does it more out of inflating her ego than for actually wanting to do something nice for the class
4/15/20, 11:31 - Marco: ofc, different opinions
4/15/20, 11:32 - Lorenzo: Haha yeah but I kind of dealing with this out of sight out of mnd
4/15/20, 11:32 - Lorenzo: but I get the frustration and I share it of course
4/15/20, 11:33 - Lorenzo: but last few days I'm not really feeling like thinking about it
4/15/20, 11:33 - Marco: good
4/15/20, 11:33 - Lorenzo: I saw my parents last saturday
4/15/20, 11:33 - Lorenzo: I called my grandpa on Monday
4/15/20, 11:33 - Lorenzo: I speak to people more often
4/15/20, 11:34 - Lorenzo: I just don't care about Jeroen and Wies because they are nto in my surroundings haha
4/15/20, 11:34 - Marco: yeah same
4/15/20, 11:34 - Marco: Also > not that you may care but
4/15/20, 11:34 - Marco: I stopped smoking haha
4/15/20, 11:34 - Marco: everything
4/15/20, 11:34 - Lorenzo: ah
4/15/20, 11:34 - Marco: for a long while and probz for good
4/15/20, 11:35 - Lorenzo: well that explains it
4/15/20, 11:35 - Marco: hahaha what
4/15/20, 11:35 - Marco: the irritability
4/15/20, 11:35 - Marco: yeah
4/15/20, 11:35 - Lorenzo: I hope you pursue in doing this
4/15/20, 11:35 - Marco: There is no going back
4/15/20, 11:36 - Lorenzo: I never smoked but I know a lot of people that tried stopping smoking
4/15/20, 11:36 - Lorenzo: multiple times
4/15/20, 11:36 - Lorenzo: so I really hope you can make it
4/15/20, 11:36 - Marco: Well I want to stop it from being a habit, that's for sure
4/15/20, 11:37 - Marco: It used to be a special thing for me and it became normality
4/15/20, 11:37 - Marco: And affects my life more than I can allow myself
4/15/20, 11:38 - Lorenzo: yeah to me the tabacco lobby is one of the most concerning problems in the world
4/15/20, 11:38 - Lorenzo: tobacco*
4/15/20, 11:38 - Marco: yeah?
4/15/20, 11:39 - Lorenzo: Have you ever gone into the history of smoking
4/15/20, 11:40 - Marco: Not really haha
4/15/20, 11:43 - Lorenzo: for a while it even was normal for kids to smoke
4/15/20, 11:44 - Lorenzo: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tobacco
4/15/20, 11:44 - Lorenzo: the first anti smoke thing was a nazi-concept haha
4/15/20, 11:45 - Marco: wow sounds interesting
4/15/20, 11:45 - Marco: I can imagine that only the worst of the worst can lie in a piece of paper that is explicitly sold to degrade your health
4/15/20, 11:46 - Lorenzo: well yeah and it also doesn't really help because I've got asthma
4/15/20, 11:46 - Lorenzo: and alot of people have lung conditions because their families smoke
4/15/20, 11:47 - Lorenzo: and there could be an argument about parents not smoking but I believe it's more about the fact that first time smoking still happens around the preteen years
4/15/20, 11:47 - Lorenzo: and why do people do it at that age? because people say that it's cool to do
4/15/20, 11:48 - Lorenzo: I know people smoke a lot and how people use it
4/15/20, 11:48 - Lorenzo: and even that it's so much incorporated that some companies only give breaks of you smoke or not (I've experienced it with an internship or two)
4/15/20, 13:34 - Marco: isn't this the premise for a family guy episode
4/15/20, 13:34 - Marco: and btw I'm stopping with weed, that's my main concern now
4/15/20, 13:34 - Marco: And ofc also tobacco
4/15/20, 13:51 - Lorenzo: haha ok
4/15/20, 13:51 - Lorenzo: I was talking to brecht

4/16/20, 09:16 - Marco: But dankz
4/16/20, 09:21 - Lorenzo: - The official press conference will come in a week, this was one to prevent the world from devastation
- €300 million for the cultural sector 
- Every business / entertainment branche / cafés and restaurant / schools (so basically every sector in the economy) etc need to come with good plans to deal with the 1,5 meter society. Entrepeneurs need to be creative and think their plans through in order to open again. *No plan means no license to open up again* 
 which means preparing for a new society with 'versoepeling' -> easing up. 
- It is also asking questions / naming dilemma's that needs effort to think about and if we do go too fast the virus will get oxygen again 
- if the measures are relaxed, this is still very limited
- there will be more info about apps (privacy info/ research / developments / first testing)
4/16/20, 09:30 - Marco: Wow 300 million
4/16/20, 09:31 - Lorenzo: prevent = protect

4/20/20, 09:47 - Lorenzo: more questions
4/20/20, 09:48 - Lorenzo: and she was completely blocking and being offended

4/20/20, 09:48 - Marco: ;()
4/20/20, 09:48 - Lorenzo: paste your op
4/20/20, 09:48 - Marco: We deserve every single death and repercussion from COVID-19.

Lately I can't stop myself from seeing the whole human race/society (me included, ofc) as an immature kid that hasn't learned enough life lessons and cannot, for whatever reason, deal with things in an "adult" way and grow the f up.

This whole situation was brought upon by our total inability to deal with a now blatantly overwhelming and critical problem.

We have been warned for years by prominent people in the field that this was going to happen, but NOTHING has been done, and here we are now. We are clearly lost and confused and we are dealing with this in complete ignorance and incompetence. 

All of this, as much as every other big problem of yesterday, today, and tomorrow is on our shoulders, and we can't deal with it or assume responsibility, we keep delving into greed and egoism, we care about our own selves and our own personal "self-development": does that have any relevance in this very moment? Will it be of any importance in the foreseeable future?

I seriously hope (albeit do not believe) that this will be an opportunity to learn and mature for the whole world.
4/20/20, 09:49 - Lorenzo: this the entire opinion?
4/20/20, 09:49 - Marco: Yes
4/20/20, 09:49 - Lorenzo: or is there more?
4/20/20, 09:49 - Lorenzo: ok
4/20/20, 09:49 - Marco: That was a quick read
4/20/20, 09:49 - Lorenzo: *puts smartypants glass on
4/20/20, 09:49 - Lorenzo: lemme see
4/20/20, 09:49 - Marco: Hahaha
4/20/20, 09:51 - Lorenzo: I will reply per paragraph
4/20/20, 09:51 - Marco: Oke take your time
4/20/20, 09:51 - Marco: I'mma showah
4/20/20, 09:51 - Lorenzo: Lately I can't stop myself from seeing the whole human race/society (me included, ofc) as an immature kid that hasn't learned enough life lessons and cannot, for whatever reason, deal with things in an "adult" way and grow the f up. > first of all China's silencing of the people that were warning and the wet markets is a long overdue problem and this.
4/20/20, 09:52 - Lorenzo: We deserve every single death and repercussion from COVID-19. > well my misanthrope side agrees but I think this is a grumpy line haha
4/20/20, 09:52 - Lorenzo: This whole situation was brought upon by our total inability to deal with a now blatantly overwhelming and critical problem. > Agree
4/20/20, 09:53 - Lorenzo: We have been warned for years by prominent people in the field that this was going to happen, but NOTHING has been done, and here we are now. We are clearly lost and confused and we are dealing with this in complete ignorance and incompetence.  > Somewhat agree but then again I feel we are further then this
4/20/20, 09:53 - Lorenzo: asin passed that point
4/20/20, 09:55 - Lorenzo: All of this, as much as every other big problem of yesterday, today, and tomorrow is on our shoulders, and we can't deal with it or assume responsibility, we keep delving into greed and egoism, we care about our own selves and our own personal "self-development": does that have any relevance in this very moment? Will it be of any importance in the foreseeable future? > I think that closing down those wet markets,Gates building those 7 factories would be for the best
4/20/20, 09:55 - Lorenzo: I seriously hope (albeit do not believe) that this will be an opportunity to learn and mature for the whole world > Well agree
4/20/20, 09:56 - Lorenzo: Overall I kinda agree with what you are saying
4/20/20, 09:56 - Lorenzo: but on the other hand this is clearly an emotional piece of text
4/20/20, 09:57 - Lorenzo: good that you put your thoughts into words on paper
4/20/20, 09:59 - Lorenzo: I also think that on a global scale, we should readjust our view towards food
4/20/20, 10:00 - Lorenzo: because not only is there a pandemic, there is also sulfur shortage
4/20/20, 10:00 - Lorenzo: oop
4/20/20, 10:00 - Lorenzo: s
4/20/20, 10:00 - Lorenzo: I meant phosphorus
4/20/20, 10:23 - Marco: Gonna answer your answers
4/20/20, 10:24 - Marco: Starting from this, I agree, I'm seriously shaken by the things I see and read everyday and you clearly agree with me on this. On the other hand I can argument everything I said though
4/20/20, 10:26 - Marco: Not talking about china necessarily. I see how people act in everyday life here, and what I read about other places and I can't wrap my head around how immature of a behaviour everyone is adopting. China's silencing and wet markets are just a small part of the bigger problem, and I'm not saying it's easy to address but we don't even try, most of us seem not to even see the problem or to ignore it if they see it
4/20/20, 10:29 - Marco: Following what I said in the line before: when a kid does something wrong he learns from the consequences of the action and hopefully grows up and matures from that. The deaths and hospital overflow and economic crisis and unemployment are the consequences, and it is sad but they are the consequences of our own actions, and as such we should take responsibility for them, because to a good extent it's what we deserved from our irresponsible behaviour
4/20/20, 10:31 - Marco: And I'm talking about Gates and other experts having warned us for years that a pandemic was gonna show up soon and we were not prepared. But we did nothing about it and thought about other comparatively insignificant things that now show how unimportant they are because there is nothing important as this pandemic takes over our society
4/20/20, 10:31 - Marco: (gonna answer after lesson)
4/20/20, 10:32 - Lorenzo: we started ye
4/20/20, 10:33 - Marco: And we are not further than this because being further than this = having prevented it
4/20/20, 10:34 - Marco: It was only that haha finished
4/20/20, 10:34 - Lorenzo: I meant we passed that point
4/20/20, 10:34 - Lorenzo: not meaning proceeded
4/20/20, 10:34 - Lorenzo: but let's talk later
4/20/20, 10:34 - Marco: oh ok
4/20/20, 10:34 - Marco: ye
4/20/20, 10:37 - Marco: ahahahah
4/20/20, 10:43 - Marco: I have a question
4/20/20, 10:43 - Marco: The ideas my group is talking about today are my ideas
4/20/20, 10:44 - Marco: Is it ok if I say they are my ideas or I should say our
4/20/20, 10:44 - Marco: in your opinion
4/20/20, 10:44 - Marco: I'm really proud about them
4/20/20, 10:44 - Lorenzo: You should say you shared your thoughts
4/20/20, 10:44 - Marco: And wanted to do a personal thing but figured out it was better to use it for this
4/20/20, 10:44 - Lorenzo: And these ideas got appreciated
4/20/20, 10:44 - Lorenzo: Haha
4/20/20, 10:45 - Marco: Thank you!
4/20/20, 10:46 - Lorenzo: Hahahaha

4/21/20, 10:40 - Marco: jesussss
4/21/20, 10:40 - Marco: i dont wanna hear this voice everyday
4/21/20, 10:41 - Lorenzo: you know what's ironic?
4/21/20, 10:42 - Marco: i think im gonna say it
4/21/20, 10:43 - Marco: hahahha the dildo is nice
4/21/20, 10:43 - Marco: didnt see it though
4/21/20, 10:43 - Marco: before she said it
4/21/20, 10:43 - Lorenzo: I'm concerned about her tinderdates lol
4/21/20, 10:43 - Lorenzo: dicks are not supposed to have sharp edges
4/21/20, 10:43 - Lorenzo: XD
4/21/20, 10:44 - Marco: my internet is not working well
4/21/20, 10:46 - Lorenzo: I N F OR M AL L L L
4/21/20, 10:46 - Marco: Yeah
4/21/20, 10:51 - Marco: wouldnt this be their responsibility
4/21/20, 10:51 - Lorenzo: "HAVE YOU TRIED THE INTERNET"
4/21/20, 11:21 - Marco: Also
4/21/20, 11:21 - Marco: Just saying
4/21/20, 11:21 - Marco: We are in 5
4/21/20, 11:22 - Marco: While everyone else is in 6-7
4/21/20, 11:22 - Marco: Because effing sun yin is a ghost
4/21/20, 12:18 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
4/21/20, 12:19 - Marco: Feelin very down rn
4/21/20, 12:19 - Lorenzo: ease up fren
4/21/20, 12:19 - Lorenzo: allow it
4/21/20, 12:20 - Marco: I did, learning to do that lately
4/21/20, 12:20 - Marco: Allows you more control of the thing for some reason
4/21/20, 12:20 - Marco: As if you're seeing it from the outside almost
4/21/20, 12:20 - Lorenzo: and less resistance
4/21/20, 12:20 - Marco: So nice, but still frustrated about this whole situation
4/21/20, 12:20 - Lorenzo: ofc
4/21/20, 12:21 - Marco: And I know that if I express my concerns to these teachers I'll get an aggressive comeback
4/21/20, 12:21 - Marco: Defensive, not aggressibe
4/21/20, 12:21 - Marco: Aggressive
4/21/20, 12:21 - Lorenzo: https://www.facebook.com/thesadghostclub/
4/21/20, 12:22 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
4/21/20, 12:23 - Marco: Nice
4/21/20, 12:23 - Marco: Also, I want to ask you smth about this project
4/21/20, 12:23 - Lorenzo: sure
4/21/20, 12:24 - Marco: Because I've seen the other groups making sharp/clever critiques sometimes, such as the "naive" or the dildo thing
4/21/20, 12:24 - Marco: And our project as of know is very narrative but I have the feel that it lacks that "pointyness"
4/21/20, 12:24 - Lorenzo: well yeah
4/21/20, 12:25 - Lorenzo: but face the fact those witty things
4/21/20, 12:25 - Lorenzo: are a bit cheezy as well
4/21/20, 12:25 - Lorenzo: we embraced a different aesthetic
4/21/20, 12:25 - Marco: And I know you are really good at stuff like this, but I don't mean to put any pressure on you for this but it would be nice to think of including something like that as part of our thing
4/21/20, 12:25 - Marco: That's true
4/21/20, 12:25 - Lorenzo: naive is clever marketing
4/21/20, 12:25 - Marco: But you're super good at these kinda things and you dont make it cheezy
4/21/20, 12:25 - Lorenzo: but it's the word in reflection
4/21/20, 12:25 - Marco: True
4/21/20, 12:26 - Lorenzo: the dildo is also witty
4/21/20, 12:26 - Lorenzo: I agree
4/21/20, 12:26 - Marco: Had to translate witty
4/21/20, 12:26 - Lorenzo: but our aesthetic is more serious so idk
4/21/20, 12:26 - Lorenzo: because disney
4/21/20, 12:26 - Lorenzo: was also more serious
4/21/20, 12:26 - Marco: Yeah but does it have to be? It would be nice maybe to include some gertness ?
4/21/20, 12:26 - Lorenzo: I like that way better imo
4/21/20, 12:26 - Marco: Yeah maybe you"re right
4/21/20, 12:26 - Lorenzo: true
4/21/20, 12:26 - Marco: It"s a different kind of narrative
4/21/20, 12:27 - Marco: But it's more and more reflecting the absence of gert in the whole thing
4/21/20, 12:28 - Marco: And I don't want it to become so serious that people don't get much out of it at the end. And from witty stuff like evian or the dildo (to some extent because it's clever regarding the matter they address) you don't really get something more than a laugh which I agree with you
4/21/20, 12:29 - Marco: We are far ahead into giving deepness to our story but the whole "improvised building"ness that charachterized also last year's project is also a bit lacking imo
4/21/20, 12:29 - Lorenzo: yeah well
4/21/20, 12:29 - Marco: I know it is different
4/21/20, 12:29 - Marco: This time
4/21/20, 12:30 - Lorenzo: I'm waiting for your opinion to be done so I can react haha
4/21/20, 12:30 - Marco: But i think we could make it more """"edgy""""
4/21/20, 12:30 - Marco: Go
4/21/20, 12:34 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
4/21/20, 12:38 - Marco: Yeah you are right
4/21/20, 12:38 - Marco: <Media omitted>
4/21/20, 12:41 - Lorenzo: Yes.
4/21/20, 12:41 - Lorenzo: I agree.
4/21/20, 12:41 - Lorenzo: But that implies
4/21/20, 12:42 - Lorenzo: the teachers shutting the fuck up
4/21/20, 12:43 - Lorenzo: don't worry about that misinterpretation
4/21/20, 12:42 - Marco: <Media omitted>
4/21/20, 12:44 - Lorenzo: note: I feel blocked

4/21/20, 12:49 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
4/21/20, 12:53 - Marco: You're 100% right
4/21/20, 13:23 - Lorenzo: https://youtu.be/xVWZ6qpzTgc
4/21/20, 13:39 - Marco: Do you think we should make them notice that we have one less component
4/21/20, 13:39 - Lorenzo: Hm
4/21/20, 13:39 - Marco: Sun Yin
4/21/20, 13:39 - Marco: Thanks

4/21/20, 19:45 - Lorenzo: the clubs or bars and stuff are suffering but I still understand
4/21/20, 19:45 - Lorenzo: my summer is definitely cancelled
4/21/20, 19:45 - Lorenzo: so I'm not surprised
4/21/20, 19:46 - Lorenzo: I'm very much existential crisised atm
4/21/20, 19:46 - Lorenzo: not that is exaggerated
4/21/20, 19:46 - Lorenzo: but it's affects my mental health a bit
4/21/20, 19:46 - Marco: They do realize that the country has just entered the top 10 most infected and they are getting 1000 more infected a day right? Yesterday Grote Markt was as full of people as it is in a no-virus situation
4/21/20, 19:46 - Marco: I can understand, that goes for almost everyone
4/21/20, 19:47 - Marco: Which is why people are going out anyway
4/21/20, 19:47 - Marco: But they have to understand that if they act like this the times are gonna be longer
4/21/20, 19:47 - Lorenzo: Hey
4/21/20, 19:47 - Lorenzo: remember
4/21/20, 19:47 - Lorenzo: what have I told you before

4/26/20, 21:44 - Marco: If it may be of any help for your research
4/26/20, 21:47 - Marco: I find it very interesting how all the major food chains (kfc, burger king, mcdonald's etc.) have all kinds of posters/papers/warning/leaflets outside their restaurant mentioning that "the restaurant is currently not fully operative" anf "sorry but at the moment we only offer delivery" without EVER mentioning the word covid or corona or virus or anything that can remotely remind people of a pandemic going on
4/26/20, 21:48 - Marco: Everything is written in a very "safe" way, to reassure people and make it look like it is only a small little tiny problem "for now we can only offew delivewy sowwy :c"

5/9/20, 21:19 - Marco: sure
5/9/20, 21:20 - Lorenzo: but that's because mano negra has a similar clear tone

5/15/20, 10:12 - Lorenzo: but it's not the final thing
5/15/20, 10:13 - Marco: Nono I agree but having a week to put together the sound and the video clips is better than doing it at the last day
5/15/20, 10:13 - Lorenzo: yeah that's true
5/15/20, 10:13 - Marco: As long as I keep my sanity is fine haha and I'm surprisingly keeping it

5/15/20, 10:15 - Lorenzo: No
5/15/20, 10:16 - Marco: If not it's ok but as soon as you have one tell me before doing it
5/15/20, 10:16 - Lorenzo: ofcourse
5/15/20, 10:16 - Marco: Cause it might be that depending on the approach it has to be redone from scratch then haha

5/15/20, 10:42 - Lorenzo: so the thing is more that Emo / Scene kids were one of the strangest subcultures
5/15/20, 10:43 - Lorenzo: because they were commercially fashioned from the start
5/15/20, 10:43 - Lorenzo: most of the people I know from that scene have become the next trends
5/15/20, 10:45 - Lorenzo: that's just somethign I never understood haha, I mean tastes differ ofcourse but it's just not my cup of tea
5/15/20, 10:45 - Marco: isn't melissa also into that subculture
5/15/20, 10:46 - Lorenzo: yeah she is but if would be honest she's more the crossover goth / alternative / emo thing
5/15/20, 10:46 - Lorenzo: because I have enough of emolocks and pink eyeshadow in my puberty
5/15/20, 10:47 - Lorenzo: so when I told my friends about Melisa showing herself as an Emo
5/15/20, 10:47 - Lorenzo: my friends: the fuck they still exist? haha
5/15/20, 10:48 - Lorenzo: I mean I wasn't against the people, some of my friends also were in that spectrum and I get it
5/15/20, 10:48 - Marco: hahah I'm not really knowledgeable about the whole thing but I deep down have the same reaction whenever I see one
5/15/20, 10:48 - Marco: "spectrum" hahahah

5/15/20, 10:51 - Lorenzo: yeah but Tokio Hotel was a taboo scene hahaha
5/15/20, 10:53 - Marco: i mean it was pop
5/15/20, 10:53 - Lorenzo: pop doesn't mean shit
5/15/20, 10:53 - Lorenzo: SOAD was pop
5/15/20, 10:53 - Lorenzo: Daft Punk was pop
5/15/20, 10:53 - Lorenzo: it's a demographic, not a genre
5/15/20, 10:54 - Lorenzo: I mean katy perry and that stuff is
5/15/20, 10:55 - Lorenzo: Tokio Hotel had this typic alternative boy band
5/15/20, 10:55 - Lorenzo: but everybody didn't realize bill was a guy
5/15/20, 10:55 - Lorenzo: 'that's one hot chick'

5/17/20, 19:44 - Lorenzo: ok I have done enough for today
5/18/20, 08:55 - Lorenzo: Janine thought I was a class rep
5/18/20, 08:58 - Marco: Says a lot about the actual class rep
5/18/20, 08:58 - Lorenzo: no it doesn't
5/18/20, 08:58 - Lorenzo: it says more about the communication in our class
5/18/20, 08:59 - Lorenzo: there are supposed to be two and I'm doubting if I should do it
5/18/20, 09:03 - Marco: Well if you wanna
5/18/20, 09:03 - Marco: Personally I don't see a reason why I would do it
5/18/20, 09:03 - Lorenzo: haha I talked about this with Wies
5/18/20, 09:05 - Lorenzo: in Izzie's way I'd say it's a vibe check
5/18/20, 09:09 - Lorenzo: and I even mentioned to Wies that the overstimulation of teamwork i.e. the garden next to the failing of birthday and the lack of discipline preparing the open day are reasons why our class is like this next to the fact that people feel burdened to speak their minds because other people are talking all the time with group initiatives because they don't want my mr/mrs bad guy party pooper and don't feel heard
5/18/20, 09:10 - Marco: So
5/18/20, 09:13 - Lorenzo: ye
5/18/20, 09:14 - Marco: What does this have to do with class representation
5/18/20, 09:14 - Lorenzo: it was about the communication that represents the class haha
5/18/20, 09:15 - Marco: Yeah but we know that from a while now
5/18/20, 09:16 - Marco: And wies is certainly not the best person to mitigate the problem
5/18/20, 09:16 - Lorenzo: Haha true
5/18/20, 09:17 - Lorenzo: I feel like
5/18/20, 09:17 - Lorenzo: I'd like to do it
5/18/20, 09:17 - Lorenzo: but also thinking of my own mental health
5/18/20, 09:17 - Lorenzo: instead of going full Stanley always
5/18/20, 09:17 - Marco: That's also what I was thinking of when I said I see no reason to do it
5/18/20, 09:18 - Marco: As long as there is so much egoism and egocentrism in our class there is no class
5/18/20, 09:18 - Lorenzo: true haha
5/18/20, 09:18 - Marco: There is literally no interest from anyone in creating a community
5/18/20, 09:18 - Marco: And you becoming a representative means that you always have to seek the crumbles of sense of community that sometimes are left on the path
5/18/20, 09:19 - Lorenzo: haha and I was thinking why is that a bad thing
5/18/20, 09:19 - Lorenzo: if community were the sense of Jeroen it would be fucking eachother on LSD while he's manically laughing the entire time lol
5/18/20, 09:19 - Marco: Yeah
5/18/20, 09:20 - Lorenzo: haha charles manson reference accurate

5/18/20, 09:20 - Marco: [5/17, 18:56] Jeroen: heyy sorry celebrating my dad's birthday

5/18/20, 09:21 - Marco: This is the status quo
5/18/20, 09:21 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
5/18/20, 09:21 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
5/18/20, 09:21 - Marco: And if I cared about my mental health I wouldn't wanna represent these people
5/18/20, 09:22 - Marco: Also considering the other representative is a still stuck-in-high-school manipulator
5/18/20, 09:22 - Marco: I really would leave it be if I was you
5/18/20, 09:23 - Lorenzo: I rather be my whistle blower self
5/18/20, 09:23 - Lorenzo: walking into dave and janine's office
5/18/20, 09:23 - Lorenzo: and saying whats up and then leaving _but you heardn't from me_
5/18/20, 09:23 - Marco: Heardn't haha
5/18/20, 09:24 - Lorenzo: though I do have an idea how class is feeling and I get along with everyone
5/18/20, 09:24 - Marco: I can't wait to fill in that self-evaluation form
5/18/20, 09:25 - Marco: What makes a class rep is that + gathering a (hopefully) unanimous opinion + taking a decision
5/18/20, 09:25 - Marco: And the last two things are near impossible
5/18/20, 09:25 - Lorenzo: yes that is true
5/18/20, 09:26 - Marco: It was already like this last year when I was class rep
5/18/20, 09:26 - Marco: And this year it worsened
5/18/20, 09:26 - Lorenzo: it worsened more than worsedsershiresauce
5/18/20, 09:27 - Marco: Ye
5/18/20, 09:29 - Lorenzo: btw
5/18/20, 09:29 - Lorenzo: last week John Krasinski did an episode that he was guiding a zoom SGN wedding
5/18/20, 09:30 - Lorenzo: and he invited the office-actors to do the dances they did in the wedding episode
5/18/20, 09:31 - Marco: Hahaha nice
5/18/20, 09:31 - Lorenzo: It's a nice feelgood show though
5/18/20, 09:32 - Lorenzo: it's very cheezy but sometimes we need that rite

5/27/20, 18:27 - Lorenzo: more like that it be like that sometimes
5/27/20, 18:27 - Lorenzo: nothing negative but just some personal process
5/27/20, 18:27 - Marco: I also thought about it and it may be that I took too much on myself for this project
5/27/20, 18:29 - Marco: At the same time I think putting works from different sources together wouldn't have sorted the same feedback/result from the teachers and everyone else
5/27/20, 18:29 - Marco: This not to say that I made it better
5/27/20, 18:29 - Marco: But to say that it would have not been coherent and uniform
5/27/20, 18:29 - Marco: And I think that's better but that's my personal opinion
5/27/20, 18:30 - Marco: I'm just a bit disappointed on myself that too much of it was on me
5/27/20, 18:30 - Marco: And I brought it myself

5/28/20, 11:37 - Marco: Oooooh yeah nice

5/28/20, 16:36 - Marco: I misinterprted
5/28/20, 16:36 - Lorenzo: However it could be a nice idea tho

5/29/20, 09:55 - Marco: this is hilarious
5/29/20, 10:13 - Lorenzo: christ don't get me started hahaha
5/29/20, 10:37 - Marco: Remus is really great
5/29/20, 10:37 - Marco: I think he is my favorite teacher this year
5/29/20, 10:38 - Lorenzo: hahaha
5/29/20, 10:38 - Lorenzo: cool
5/29/20, 10:38 - Marco: So on point every time, so professional and quite funny
5/29/20, 10:38 - Marco: Lacks a bit of empathy sometimes haha
5/29/20, 10:38 - Marco: But as a teacher he is top notch imo
5/29/20, 10:38 - Lorenzo: true his allergic to bullcrap
5/29/20, 10:38 - Lorenzo: he's*
5/29/20, 10:39 - Lorenzo: I remember you calling a remark low key racist
5/29/20, 10:39 - Marco: I'm not judging him as a person
5/29/20, 10:39 - Marco: I don't like many aspects of his personality
5/29/20, 10:39 - Marco: But professionally he is impeccable
5/29/20, 10:39 - Lorenzo: strong word
5/29/20, 10:40 - Marco: Well yeah he hasn't taken a wrong step since the start I think
5/29/20, 10:40 - Lorenzo: he is skilled at what he does
5/29/20, 10:40 - Marco: And he teaches it well
5/29/20, 10:40 - Marco: He is also strict enough for my standards
5/29/20, 10:40 - Marco: Which is quite strict but not too much
5/29/20, 10:40 - Lorenzo: hahaha
5/29/20, 10:41 - Marco: You have to get your ass on the chair and focus and work to understand what he teaches
5/29/20, 10:41 - Marco: But if you do it is very rewarding
5/29/20, 10:41 - Marco: Especially on the long run
5/29/20, 10:41 - Lorenzo: * note: this is the second time I have him so I agree with what you say
5/29/20, 10:42 - Lorenzo: the things is
5/29/20, 10:42 - Lorenzo: he prefers initiative
5/29/20, 10:43 - Marco: Well it's a damn art academy i wouldn't expect otherwise
5/29/20, 10:43 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
5/29/20, 10:46 - Lorenzo: still I think impeccable is a bit romantically put that's just my taste I guess, 
I find him to be a stimulating teacher with the right constructive feedback qualities to pinpoint it and he's fun in communication
5/29/20, 10:46 - Marco: Impeccable means that I don't have any remark on his way of teaching from the very first lesson
5/29/20, 10:47 - Marco: Not even a detail
5/29/20, 10:47 - Marco: That's my definition of impeccable
5/29/20, 10:48 - Lorenzo: I guess I think it sounds too much like perfect or something
5/29/20, 10:48 - Marco: Perfect = no mistakes
5/29/20, 10:48 - Lorenzo: but maybe that's just my mood lol
5/29/20, 10:48 - Marco: And he didnt make any imo
5/29/20, 10:48 - Marco: Or for what concerns mean
5/29/20, 10:48 - Marco: Me*
5/29/20, 10:48 - Marco: Wtf
5/29/20, 10:49 - Marco: Maybe in a longer timeframe he will and I will readjust my judgement
5/29/20, 10:49 - Marco: But almost a whole semester is long enough for me
5/29/20, 10:50 - Lorenzo: yes and please do in a published statement with rectified information according to MLA/Chicago standards and fact-checked by your local newsgroup

6/7/20, 12:23 - Marco: like he didn't even try
6/7/20, 12:23 - Marco: it's like we're advertising a sink and his tagline is "get water. Sink"
6/7/20, 12:24 - Marco: and this is even creative cause it has sort of a double ,meaning
6/7/20, 12:24 - Marco: see even if I try I can't amount to his total carelessness and elementarity
6/7/20, 12:24 - Lorenzo: sink for yourself
6/7/20, 12:24 - Marco: sorry if I sound arrogant
6/7/20, 12:24 - Marco: but for real wtf
6/7/20, 12:24 - Lorenzo: hahaha I understand
6/7/20, 12:25 - Marco: idk it just irritates me
6/7/20, 12:25 - Marco: cause it doesn't stimulate me at all
6/7/20, 12:25 - Marco: like wtf if this is the standard
6/7/20, 12:25 - Lorenzo: Hahahaha
6/7/20, 12:25 - Lorenzo: aww
6/7/20, 12:25 - Lorenzo: that really suck tho
6/7/20, 12:25 - Lorenzo: s
6/7/20, 12:25 - Marco: ffs
6/7/20, 12:25 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
6/7/20, 12:25 - Marco: i'm seriously questioning if i should join next year
6/7/20, 12:25 - Lorenzo: no but Jeroen a egotistical fucktard
6/7/20, 12:26 - Marco: how does he not see it
6/7/20, 12:26 - Marco: how absolutely bland what he says and does is
6/7/20, 12:26 - Marco: goddamn it
6/7/20, 12:27 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
6/7/20, 12:28 - Lorenzo: I really enjoy working with Mariela in a group
6/7/20, 12:28 - Lorenzo: she is productive and shows initiative and just says how it is haha
6/7/20, 12:28 - Marco: not only because of him
6/7/20, 12:28 - Marco: ofc
6/7/20, 12:28 - Marco: also because they are planning alternate days lessons
6/7/20, 12:29 - Marco: and the dynamics of our class I can't stand
6/7/20, 12:29 - Marco: it's him, wies, roberto etc.
6/7/20, 12:29 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
6/7/20, 12:29 - Marco: no i don't, i don't even see these people these days
6/7/20, 12:29 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
6/7/20, 12:29 - Marco: yeah may be
6/7/20, 12:30 - Marco: but what I'm saying I've been thinking for a while and it's faxxx
6/7/20, 12:30 - Marco: and facts don't care about my feelings you kno
6/7/20, 12:30 - Marco: yes i am quoting ben shapiro
6/7/20, 12:30 - Lorenzo: no but if you just think these facts
6/7/20, 12:30 - Lorenzo: in your midn
6/7/20, 12:30 - Lorenzo: while being in these times
6/7/20, 12:31 - Lorenzo: everythings sounds as facts
6/7/20, 12:31 - Lorenzo: because there's no proper feedback in your midn
6/7/20, 12:31 - Marco: it is a fact that I don't wanna pay the same price for half the school, of which one half is with people I can't really stand and in a class that can't work together towards a goal
6/7/20, 12:35 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
6/7/20, 12:39 - Marco: no but back then it was different. I still want to finish the school and I think I am capable of doing it (especially when I see things like this ^). But I am getting graded on this shitty project as well and I don't want my grade and work and portfolio to be fucked up by these people that put no effort if not into manipulating others to get something in return
6/7/20, 12:39 - Lorenzo: then stand upfor yourself
6/7/20, 12:39 - Lorenzo: in your portfolio
6/7/20, 12:40 - Marco: Also, if we have school for half the days, I have the right to not accept doing it if it has to cost the same
6/7/20, 12:40 - Marco: I'd rather take a gap year and do some experience
6/7/20, 12:40 - Marco: which i feel like I lack
6/7/20, 12:40 - Marco: and then come back enriched
6/7/20, 12:40 - Lorenzo: ok
6/7/20, 12:41 - Marco: <Media omitted>
6/7/20, 12:41 - Lorenzo: tbh I think it's a bit premature to think about this already, I understand
6/7/20, 12:41 - Marco: for sure, didn't take any final decision
6/7/20, 12:41 - Marco: just considering it
6/7/20, 12:41 - Lorenzo: but you should focus on ending the year
6/7/20, 12:41 - Marco: i have time until august to decide
6/7/20, 12:41 - Marco: yes
6/7/20, 12:41 - Lorenzo: and then do this
6/7/20, 12:42 - Lorenzo: because wining like the biatch that you are won't get you to that ultimate IMD art warrior enriched with skills
6/7/20, 12:42 - Lorenzo: ❤️
6/7/20, 12:42 - Marco: hahahah
6/7/20, 12:43 - Marco: not sure if I wanna be defined as an IMD art warrior ever in my life but I appreciate the words and I let them guide me through this day
6/7/20, 12:43 - Marco: that obviously is starting in the worst way
6/7/20, 12:43 - Marco: i answered "i know right, but I'm serious"
6/7/20, 12:44 - Marco: i'm gonna destroy that piece of shit in my portfolio
6/7/20, 12:44 - Marco: goddamn he gets on my nerves

6/7/20, 12:48 - Marco: hahahah

6/7/20, 12:49 - Lorenzo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2s0nB2VPvs
6/7/20, 12:49 - Marco: he looks like an old baby satan

6/8/20, 19:43 - Marco: I thought you started it already
6/8/20, 19:44 - Marco: You mean publishing
6/8/20, 19:44 - Lorenzo: I want to put it online
6/8/20, 19:44 - Lorenzo: yes.
6/8/20, 19:44 - Marco: No I don't know anything about it, did I say the opposite?
6/8/20, 19:44 - Lorenzo: oh ok
6/8/20, 19:44 - Marco: You should look for hosting and domain mediawiki
6/8/20, 19:44 - Marco: Possibly free ig
6/8/20, 19:44 - Marco: Even though we maybe have a budget for collectives
6/8/20, 19:45 - Lorenzo: I mean I have my domain and host already
6/8/20, 19:45 - Marco: Perfect
6/8/20, 19:45 - Lorenzo: what do you think www.lorenzoquint.nl is on haha
6/8/20, 19:45 - Marco: There must be a way to just directly upload the media wiki on the host and just link it
6/8/20, 19:45 - Marco: I don't think it's too difficult or different from a regular project
6/8/20, 19:46 - Lorenzo: you mean just upload it from the mamp localhost to my folder
6/8/20, 19:46 - Lorenzo: I'm just gonna try it I guess
6/8/20, 19:47 - Marco: Ye
6/8/20, 19:49 - Lorenzo: ok uploading now haha
6/8/20, 19:49 - Lorenzo: *gulp
6/8/20, 19:51 - Marco: Gasp
6/8/20, 19:51 - Lorenzo: this might take a while
6/8/20, 19:54 - Lorenzo: ok wait I was now copying EVERYTHING in htdocs
6/8/20, 19:54 - Lorenzo: haha
6/8/20, 20:07 - Lorenzo: if it doesn't work like this I'm gonna work on this to find out how it works ENTIRE TOMORROW
6/9/20, 09:48 - Marco: Did you manage
6/9/20, 09:48 - Lorenzo: nope but someone advised to look at some lighter alternatives
6/9/20, 09:48 - Lorenzo: and those are already way more clearer in installing
6/9/20, 09:49 - Lorenzo: I'll get back to it
6/9/20, 09:49 - Marco: Goed
6/9/20, 09:49 - Lorenzo: " mediawiki is a bit of giant monster, depending on what you need there could be some lightweight alternatives. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DokuWiki , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PmWiki , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zim_(software). That last one is more of a local note taking application, but I think you can easily uploads its files to your webserver (not sure)."
6/9/20, 09:50 - Marco: Hahah giant monster
6/9/20, 09:52 - Lorenzo: https://v2.nl/archive/people/dennis-de-bel/ this guy has some knowledge
6/9/20, 09:53 - Lorenzo: he was the one helping me and he's a very nice guy so I hope this is the golden answer
6/9/20, 09:59 - Lorenzo: another thing I wanna shar
6/9/20, 09:59 - Lorenzo: e
6/9/20, 09:59 - Lorenzo: today there was a press conference of a group called Generation Y
6/9/20, 09:59 - Lorenzo: or Coalition Y
6/9/20, 10:00 - Lorenzo: and their mission is to have the people of this generation have more input concerning the fact that this is the generation that is responsible for the future haha
6/9/20, 10:09 - Marco: Uhhm ok how do they intend to accomplish the mission

6/11/20, 11:59 - Lorenzo: it's not about it tho
6/11/20, 11:59 - Lorenzo: it was more about how almost everything we know today as pop(ular) music
6/11/20, 12:00 - Lorenzo: derives from then slaves singing / shouting / praying for a better day by their gospel 
folklores / tribal singing etc
6/11/20, 12:01 - Marco: Yeah very relevant in the context

“Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And the process is continuing day by day and minute by 
minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.”

7/8/20, 13:54 - Lorenzo: you went places
7/8/20, 13:54 - Marco: While everyone around me is doing stuff
7/8/20, 13:54 - Lorenzo: so?
7/8/20, 13:54 - Marco: Yeah I mean 'art-wise'
7/8/20, 13:55 - Lorenzo: oh no
7/8/20, 13:55 - Lorenzo: you are not productive
7/8/20, 13:55 - Lorenzo: so you are not functioning
7/8/20, 13:55 - Lorenzo: so you feel guilty
7/8/20, 13:55 - Lorenzo: comparing yourself to others
7/8/20, 13:56 - Lorenzo: a sense of insecurity that is enhanced shitty weather / cold / tiredness  and a dip coming home from a trip to work again
7/8/20, 13:56 - Lorenzo: by*
7/8/20, 13:57 - Marco: Well actually
7/8/20, 13:57 - Marco: I would rather work all the time rn
7/8/20, 13:57 - Marco: Just to not stay sitting at home drowning in this feeling that I can't create shit
7/8/20, 13:58 - Lorenzo: still hearing the guilt my friend
7/8/20, 13:58 - Lorenzo: I think if I'm totally honest
7/8/20, 13:59 - Lorenzo: that when you sit down you get confronted with these thoughts and rather be active to avoid them but once you get home they'll be there again
7/8/20, 13:59 - Lorenzo: maybe you should meditate or something
7/8/20, 13:59 - Lorenzo: remember
7/8/20, 14:00 - Lorenzo: you don't _have_ to be creative when you are not _feeling_ creative 

this semester was intense anyway
7/8/20, 14:00 - Marco: I agree
7/8/20, 14:01 - Lorenzo: this is a good slogan
7/8/20, 14:01 - Marco: It's just difficult to believe when this doesn't seem to be valid for other people
7/8/20, 14:01 - Marco: But maybe it is just bias
7/8/20, 14:01 - Lorenzo: is that some fomo
7/8/20, 14:01 - Marco: The only thing that is comforting me lately is the pictures I'm taking
7/8/20, 14:02 - Lorenzo: why should you feel comforted all the time
7/8/20, 14:02 - Lorenzo: emotions are so damn complex that you can't be happy all the time and accepting that is a relief
7/8/20, 14:02 - Marco: Dang
7/8/20, 14:03 - Marco: That is 14 inch deep
7/8/20, 14:03 - Marco: At least
7/8/20, 14:03 - Lorenzo: I don't feel 'good' today as well but I'm fine with it
7/8/20, 14:04 - Lorenzo: the reason why burnout culture exists 
and why toxic positivity exists
7/8/20, 14:04 - Lorenzo: is that people want to be happy all the time
7/8/20, 14:04 - Lorenzo: the goal is to be happy
7/8/20, 14:04 - Lorenzo: but happiness is a moment so you can't chase a moment
7/8/20, 14:05 - Lorenzo: AND THAT COMRADE IS WHY WE HAVE TO
7/8/20, 14:05 - Lorenzo: _SEIZE THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION_
7/8/20, 14:05 - Marco: Hahahahah
7/8/20, 14:07 - Lorenzo: "In a capitalist system, Marx believed that the society was made up of two classes, the bourgeoisie, or business owners who control the means of production, and the proletariat, or workers whose labor transforms raw commodities into valuable economic goods."
7/8/20, 14:07 - Lorenzo: haha I was not even that far with my talk
7/8/20, 14:07 - Lorenzo: off*
7/8/20, 14:08 - Lorenzo: Happiness has became a economic good as well
7/8/20, 14:08 - Lorenzo: but ok step from the marxist thing
7/8/20, 14:09 - Lorenzo: I just meant that wanting to force yourself into being happy
7/8/20, 14:09 - Lorenzo: just makes you depressed
7/8/20, 14:09 - Marco: Hahaha yeah I didn't expect it to get this far
7/8/20, 14:09 - Lorenzo: become*
7/8/20, 14:09 - Marco: I don't wanna be happy, I wanna be more creative/motivated to create
7/8/20, 14:09 - Lorenzo: yeah
7/8/20, 14:10 - Lorenzo: but what do you have to do to achieve it
7/8/20, 14:10 - Lorenzo: do you allow yourself to have the emotion 
or are you forcing yourself to not want to have the emotion, that which makes you feel worse
7/8/20, 14:11 - Lorenzo: because then we are talking about the desire
7/8/20, 14:11 - Marco: Which emotion
7/8/20, 14:12 - Lorenzo: the emotion is that you want to be creative
but that you are not right now and that is the struggle
7/8/20, 14:13 - Marco: Yeah I am trying to repress it
7/8/20, 14:13 - Marco: The struggle
7/8/20, 14:13 - Lorenzo: are you trying to resist the emotion?
7/8/20, 14:13 - Lorenzo: and the struggle?
7/8/20, 14:13 - Marco: Well yeah
7/8/20, 14:13 - Lorenzo: because that means that you are processing something that is a bubble
7/8/20, 14:14 - Marco: I get what you mean
7/8/20, 14:14 - Lorenzo: wait I want to mention one more thing
7/8/20, 14:14 - Marco: Go for it
7/8/20, 14:19 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
7/8/20, 15:50 - Marco: Yeah yeah totally makes sense
7/8/20, 15:51 - Marco: I guess there is more than one, as in, deeper ones from the past (because I often get into this state) but also a more actual one which is my roommate thing I talked to you about
7/8/20, 15:51 - Marco: Thanks anyway for taking the time and effort
7/8/20, 15:51 - Marco: I'd do the same if you need it

8/20/20, 20:28 - Lorenzo: :(
8/20/20, 20:28 - Marco: Which is, that my father resigned his job in what to him is some sort of psychological terror war he's been playing on my family since the same couple years

8/20/20, 20:29 - Lorenzo: ❤️ :( bro
8/20/20, 20:29 - Marco: So we need to see if there is a way to solve this situation but rn i'm clueless
8/20/20, 20:29 - Lorenzo: did you try to connect kabk about it
8/20/20, 20:29 - Marco: And continuing an art education in this situation is also not a priority unfortunately
8/20/20, 20:30 - Marco: I will but i want to know what my mom and sis are gonna do about it first
8/20/20, 20:30 - Marco: I don't wanna leave them alone, also kabk ain't gonna pay my rent
8/20/20, 20:31 - Marco: Thanks for concern
8/20/20, 20:31 - Marco: Btw no need to say anything about it, just wanted to give the real reason about why I may very well not come back at least this year

8/20/20, 20:32 - Lorenzo: medical stuff from my mom and bro
8/20/20, 20:33 - Lorenzo: the entire reason I have redone the first year was because it was impossible to do

9/16/20, 08:53 - Marco: No not yet haha

9/16/20, 09:00 - Lorenzo: ikr
9/16/20, 09:07 - Marco: It is possible to do 2 in one semester right?
9/16/20, 09:07 - Lorenzo: I guess
9/16/20, 09:07 - Lorenzo: y
9/16/20, 09:07 - Marco: Mhmh
9/16/20, 09:08 - Marco: Cause I'm looking with interest at the last one
9/16/20, 09:08 - Marco: Future Framing
9/16/20, 09:08 - Marco: I think would be really useful and would help me put things into perspective in this time where I'm uncertain about this path
9/16/20, 09:08 - Marco: And I also wanna do a practical one
9/16/20, 09:09 - Marco: Either the Studio Photography one or the Publication one
9/16/20, 09:09 - Lorenzo: it's a half semester ist right
9/16/20, 09:09 - Marco: Yes I saw
9/16/20, 09:09 - Marco: So even convenient
9/16/20, 09:09 - Lorenzo: I am doubting a bit
9/16/20, 09:09 - Marco: Now I'm trying to choose between this two
9/16/20, 09:09 - Marco: Tell me
9/16/20, 09:10 - Lorenzo: the interspecies village seems cool bc my disability ideas
but like exploring the game engine also seems like a nice way to get really familiar and confident in Unity3D
9/16/20, 09:11 - Lorenzo: I have the idea that I know just a certain aspect ofUnity
9/16/20, 09:11 - Lorenzo: and I'd like to grow in it more
9/16/20, 09:11 - Marco: Are you sure that that course is gonna go beyond that aspect that you know?
9/16/20, 09:11 - Lorenzo: that is where the questions are asked during the market
9/16/20, 09:12 - Marco: Hehe true
9/16/20, 09:12 - Marco: Gl with that
9/16/20, 09:12 - Marco: Starts at 10 right?
9/16/20, 09:12 - Lorenzo: what would you think
9/16/20, 09:12 - Lorenzo: like looking at the IST
9/16/20, 09:12 - Lorenzo: thinking like
9/16/20, 09:12 - Lorenzo: this would be good for Lorenzo
9/16/20, 09:12 - Lorenzo: haha
9/16/20, 09:13 - Marco: Yeah both of em but I think the second one more
9/16/20, 09:13 - Marco: Cause the first one I feel like it's a bit of a dead end
9/16/20, 09:13 - Marco: You do that and it's that
9/16/20, 09:13 - Marco: The unity one opens up possibilities
9/16/20, 09:13 - Lorenzo: you mean the Waag one
9/16/20, 09:13 - Marco: Ye
9/16/20, 09:13 - Marco: Whereas the Waag one is mostly an endpoint
9/16/20, 09:13 - Lorenzo: ye
9/16/20, 09:13 - Lorenzo: and like the madmax also seems cool but idk if I'd like to do it
9/16/20, 09:14 - Marco: Haha yeah but I wouldn't do it either
9/16/20, 09:14 - Marco: I really feel like it has little to do with MadMax
9/16/20, 09:15 - Marco: You have to create a short film or smth, with a presentation at the Eye filmmuseum at some point
9/16/20, 09:15 - Lorenzo: Besides
9/16/20, 09:15 - Marco: Sarah did it last year i think
9/16/20, 09:15 - Marco: Seemed like a loootta work
9/16/20, 09:15 - Lorenzo: I feel that the IST would be the only way to work with something 3D / unity this semester
9/16/20, 09:15 - Marco: Ye go for it
9/16/20, 09:16 - Marco: There is also the good ol flexible media
9/16/20, 09:16 - Lorenzo: because a year ago this was my second chocie]
9/16/20, 09:16 - Lorenzo: choice
9/16/20, 09:16 - Lorenzo: yeah that's also right....
9/16/20, 09:16 - Marco: But idk if I were you
9/16/20, 09:16 - Marco: I would still ask for the unity one
9/16/20, 09:16 - Marco: Clear yo doubts
9/16/20, 09:16 - Lorenzo: but working on a distance with ferenc seems like a lot of frustrenc
9/16/20, 09:17 - Marco: Idk
9/16/20, 09:17 - Marco: It felt like working on a distance even when I was there
9/16/20, 09:17 - Marco: Lol
9/16/20, 09:17 - Lorenzo: haha yeah butI heard from Sarah thatcontact was weird
9/16/20, 09:17 - Marco: Very
9/16/20, 09:18 - Lorenzo: but maybe Sarah didn't do effort to contact him
9/16/20, 09:18 - Lorenzo: it is Sarah still :')
9/16/20, 09:18 - Marco: Mmmh idk
9/16/20, 09:18 - Marco: But yeah idk I would still try to do something different from FM again
9/16/20, 09:18 - Lorenzo: on the other hand
9/16/20, 09:19 - Lorenzo: there's still next year
9/16/20, 09:19 - Lorenzo: so maybe now do the unity thing and next year polish it with flexible media hahah
9/16/20, 09:30 - Marco: Oooh I'm now seeing
9/16/20, 09:30 - Lorenzo: ?

9/17/20, 11:36 - Lorenzo: it's that
9/17/20, 11:36 - Lorenzo: and
9/17/20, 11:36 - Lorenzo: Assignment part 1_ [present] investigation :Investigate your current identity. Think of your clothing, soft materials, fabrics that match your identities.Assignment part 2_ [past] material research:Go back in your memory and find material that you have worn as a child. Make an inventory of the meanings of textiles in your youth. Look in your mind for 2D and 3D textiles. Collect, compare, and select text, objects, and images that relate to your childhood with an emphasis on the role of textiles therein.By immersing yourself in your childhood, you come across textiles in the form of clothing, interior, toys, etc. Collecting and comparing the objects themselves, descriptions, and visual material lead to characterizing that period concerning design, content, and use of colour. These are the ingredients from which you start your form and material research. If you no longer have a particular material available, find a similar material that evokes this memory and bring it with you.
9/17/20, 11:36 - Lorenzo: that's like the pdf
9/17/20, 11:53 - Marco: thankss
9/17/20, 11:54 - Marco: anna's assignment is kinda difficult

9/17/20, 12:06 - Marco: About 2 pages
9/17/20, 12:06 - Marco: And a letter can get fairly personal
9/17/20, 12:06 - Lorenzo: 3 academic and 3 of choice

9/17/20, 12:12 - Marco: True you"re good at that
9/17/20, 12:13 - Lorenzo: I probably write something about hippies and nazis coinciding in the antimask thing
9/17/20, 12:13 - Marco: I don't have "3" written, i have values and passion
9/17/20, 12:14 - Marco: I'm thinking that something that would give me a lot of material to write is something about the ciry

9/22/20, 18:23 - Lorenzo: it's just something  I have a huge interest in
9/22/20, 18:23 - Marco: ofc
9/22/20, 18:23 - Marco: with good reasons
9/22/20, 18:23 - Lorenzo: bit heavy to say
9/22/20, 18:26 - Lorenzo: but I think(this is just a thought that slipped my mind) the 'disabled' people are being disabled from their own 'disorder' or handicap by the older institutes that shape the society at some point. For they are not being able to adapt.
9/22/20, 18:27 - Lorenzo: yesterday I was talking with Alexia about the disability options on the place where we werk
9/22/20, 18:27 - Lorenzo: haha work*
9/22/20, 18:27 - Lorenzo: WERK IT BISH YAAAAS
9/22/20, 18:27 - Marco: werkse mannnn
9/22/20, 18:27 - Lorenzo: like there is a new infrastructure
9/22/20, 18:28 - Lorenzo: but still a high staircase to upstairs
9/22/20, 18:28 - Lorenzo: and no elevators or so
9/22/20, 18:29 - Lorenzo: anyway
9/22/20, 18:29 - Lorenzo: it's so nice that dutch broadcasters make reports on it
9/22/20, 18:29 - Lorenzo: and call institutions
9/22/20, 18:30 - Lorenzo: and ask what is possible and can be so transparent
9/22/20, 18:30 - Lorenzo: there's a 17 year old guy with 3 maps and shitload of research on the CEASE
9/22/20, 18:31 - Marco: yeah but this is true, it is comparable to what they say about mental health problems as well. They "don't exist" in a sense because they are difficulties to adapt to certain constants of society
9/22/20, 18:31 - Lorenzo: yep
9/22/20, 18:31 - Lorenzo: because the system is strictly fixed so it don't work for us all haha
9/22/20, 18:31 - Marco: yeah
9/22/20, 18:31 - Marco: social anxiety is subjected especially to this treatment
9/22/20, 18:31 - Marco: I have read countless time of people saying that it's a construct of capitalism
9/22/20, 18:32 - Marco: and depression as well
9/22/20, 18:32 - Lorenzo: yEt wItH wE wOrK fOr It ~woke quote

9/22/20, 18:32 - Lorenzo: HAHHAA
9/22/20, 18:32 - Lorenzo: 50 years ago nobody smiled on the street in footage
9/22/20, 18:33 - Marco: well not nobody
9/22/20, 18:33 - Marco: but yeah

I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

1/5/21, 10:28 - Lorenzo: Good morning Anna, 

I have a question about your additional remark in the e-mail! 
 I would assume that the rounding up of our essays and finishing / sending our writing portfolio to you this week has a higher priority (for this week) than the publication?
Because I have no idea about the status of the publication. 

Best wishes! 
Lorenzo

1/28/21, 14:44 - Lorenzo: "if you read the tabloid press or any of the letters in any opinion pages or the comments, god forbid, on any website, it'd be easy to become convinced that the human race is on a mission to divide things into two clean columns. This sort of pervasive black-and-white-ism. Everything has to be good or evil. Or healthy or deadly. Or natural or chemical. Our troops in iraq are good and pedophiles are evil, ignoring the fact that some troops like kiddies and some pedos have guns. If you eat these berries or drink this juice, you will be miraculously healthful and you will live forever, but if you take this toxin or have this vaccine, you will get cancer and die or you will get autism and you won't like hugs. And everything organic and natural is good, ignoring the fact that organic, natural substances include arsenic and poo and crocodiles. And everything chemical is bad, ignoring the fact that everything is chemicals... Everything is chemicals. The day they discover yoga mats are carcinogenic will be the happiest day of my life. ".

2/3/21, 13:09 - Lorenzo: The meeting was the whole hour, and it was a good conversation in getting to know each other. 
The internship will probably be mostly from home. Jelle will tell me next week about whether it is possible (because of covid + home workload) for someone to be my 'mentor' or like 'begeleider'.  
In the meantime I need to gather the technical info for the internship  (hours, context, what is wanted from kabk, what is needed from SETUP). So he still couldn't really say if it is a GO but I will know it in a week.

2/4/21, 19:19 - Lorenzo: Hoi Jelle van Setup! 


Ik ben Lorenzo Quint en ik studeer interactive media design aan de Koninklijke Academie van Beeldende Kunsten in Den Haag. Ik zit momenteel in mijn 3e leerjaar en ik ben opzoek naar een stageplaats vanaf april tot juli 2021! 


De reden waarom SETUP hiervoor geschikt is, is omdat ik erg geïnteresseerd in jullie onderwerpen! Zoals digitale ethiek, zorgsystemen, duurzaamheid. Wat mij het meeste interesseert is de provocerende ideeën over de toekomst in sociaal, ethisch en technologisch aspecten. Ik raak erg enthousiast als ik de .sorry campagne zie en ook de kritische houding tegenover technologie. Ik zie ook dat jullie veel bezig zijn met kritiek leveren op systemen. Ik vind dit ook interessant om mee te werken. Van huis uit heb ik leren omgaan met verschillende vormen van bureaucratie. Een aantal familieleden zijn enigszins ‘afhankelijk’ van een aantal instanties en de rompslomp die daar voor moet gebeuren is fysiek en digitaal vervelend. Ik ben overigens mantelzorger voor mijn moeder geweest. Sinds mijn broer in een rolstoel zit, bekijk ik de wereld op een andere manier en zie ik hoeveel er anders kan. Dit inspireert mij ook en maakt alles een stuk menselijker. Er is simpelweg een hoop in de wereld dat er goed op papier uitziet maar in het echt verkeerd uitpakt en daar wil ik zelf aan meedenken in hoe dat beter kan maar ook om het te benoemen. 


Vorig jaar ben ik erachter gekomen dat ik het leuk vind om te onderzoeken en de resultaten daarvan te gebruiken in mijn ontwerp/kunst. Zo heb ik vorig jaar de Albert Heijn bekeken vanuit de grondbeginselen van hun supermarkt en ben ik dat gaan vergelijken met hoe het er nu voor staat. Maar ook bijvoorbeeld wat voor informatie er afgelopen maanden over covid-19 werd gedeeld en dat audiovisueel ontleed en bij de verspreiders gaan kijken wat voor achtergrond en doel erachter zit. Daarnaast heb ik ook ervaring met systemen zoals de zorg (bijv. mantelzorger en familie die afhankelijk is van gemeente en bureaucratie). Mijn werk valt wel samen te vatten als kritiek op vastgeroeste systemen die best wel eens op de schop kunnen en vooral ook hilarisch bekritiseerd. 


Ik zie dat jullie zoeken naar een onderzoeksvragende stagiair zoeken, mijn opleiding heeft niet een specifieke onderzoeksvraag. Het draait er bij deze stage om dat ik ook ervaring op doe bij een organisatie / bedrijf / kunstenaar. Het lijkt mij vooral leuk om mee te denken en werken bij SETUP! 




Het lijkt mij in ieder geval leuk om met je en jullie in contact te komen, zij het in zoom / teams of in het echt! 

Met vriendelijke groet, 

Lorenzo Quint

2/8/21, 10:57 - Lorenzo: and then Leon had a theory that people were introduced to the smart life at such a young age that they actually don't know how to deal with both reality and also imagination
2/8/21, 11:00 - Marco: I don't know who he is but sounds interesting
2/8/21, 11:00 - Lorenzo: I just had a conversation with Kim that we had a smartphone from a time that it didn't affect our daily lifes at such an early stage and that there are currently millions of kids being documented without even having the consciousness of awareness and when they start to hit puberty they will see themselves online without even realizing
2/8/21, 11:00 - Lorenzo: that they were documented from 0-11
2/8/21, 11:00 - Marco: Yeah it's pretty sick

3/1/21, 13:01 - Lorenzo: from the start
3/1/21, 13:01 - Marco: god
3/1/21, 13:01 - Marco: hahahahah
3/1/21, 13:03 - Lorenzo: what we are saying is

3/1/21, 13:04 - Lorenzo: what we are talking about

3/1/21, 13:04 - Marco: to always put whatever you believe in in question
3/1/21, 13:04 - Lorenzo: :D
3/1/21, 13:05 - Marco: yeah i guess it is too hurtful for some people's sensible little heart for their opinion to be attacked
3/1/21, 13:05 - Marco: 😢
3/1/21, 13:05 - Lorenzo: but now we are talking as if we NEED to be in social media spaces
3/1/21, 13:06 - Marco: 😳
3/1/21, 13:06 - Lorenzo: ofc it can help
3/1/21, 13:06 - Lorenzo: but I am not liking the idea that we need social media spaces
3/1/21, 13:06 - Lorenzo: it's like
3/1/21, 13:06 - Lorenzo: being outside
3/1/21, 13:06 - Marco: I wouldn't expect any other belief from someone who's moniker is "lil internet"
3/1/21, 13:06 - Lorenzo: and watching other people
3/1/21, 13:06 - Lorenzo: being outside
3/1/21, 13:06 - Marco: flaneuring ;)

3/1/21, 13:07 - Marco: but yeah I was talking with leo before that I was wondering if social media is maybe just a hype of this half century
3/1/21, 13:07 - Marco: like tiktok
3/1/21, 13:07 - Marco: or even the whole internet itself
3/1/21, 13:07 - Marco: maybe it's just a trend
3/1/21, 13:09 - Lorenzo: myeah
3/1/21, 13:09 - Lorenzo: it's also like
3/1/21, 13:09 - Lorenzo: keeping social media as a tool
3/1/21, 13:09 - Marco: ye
3/1/21, 13:09 - Lorenzo: it's getting old like broken cloth

3/3/21, 13:16 - Marco: I think for whatever app you use you have the risk to fall in an echo chamber and it is up to you to integrate with totally different things
3/3/21, 13:17 - Marco: _[types angrily]_
3/3/21, 13:17 - Lorenzo: lol yeah but discover weekly is just hyping up music that is on festivals the next year
3/3/21, 13:17 - Marco: not necessarily
3/3/21, 13:17 - Lorenzo: or like these
3/3/21, 13:17 - Lorenzo: _sunday morning_ playlists
3/3/21, 13:17 - Marco: I find a lot of veeery niche music through discover weekly
3/3/21, 13:17 - Marco: yeah those suck
3/3/21, 13:17 - Marco: but discover weekly can be pretty good if you "train" it right
3/3/21, 13:18 - Marco: but those kind of playlist are location based
3/3/21, 13:18 - Marco: meaning, what are the people in that region listening to mostly
3/3/21, 13:18 - Marco: discover weekly is based on what you listen
3/3/21, 13:18 - Lorenzo: alot of it is commodified
3/3/21, 13:18 - Marco: and sure many times it is similar things to what you already have but sometimes it gives some gems
3/3/21, 13:19 - Marco: for me it gives really niche and varied results
3/3/21, 13:19 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>

3/15/21, 12:32 - Lorenzo: enforcing your profile lol
3/15/21, 12:32 - Marco: Ahahaha this 4th wall breaking
3/15/21, 12:33 - Lorenzo: well I think these are 7 walls
3/15/21, 12:33 - Lorenzo: looking at all the layers
3/15/21, 12:33 - Marco: Hahahaha
3/15/21, 12:33 - Marco: Yeah
3/15/21, 12:34 - Lorenzo: it's like a blanketfort combined with zoom hahahah
3/15/21, 12:34 - Lorenzo: Yes I will start watching WestWorld again
3/15/21, 12:35 - Lorenzo: they convinced me
3/15/21, 12:35 - Marco: Hahahaha
3/15/21, 12:41 - Marco: This is literally putting an etiquette on yourself
3/15/21, 12:41 - Lorenzo: Virtueism
3/15/21, 12:41 - Lorenzo: I like that term hahaha
3/15/21, 12:45 - Lorenzo: they have a nice vocabulary
3/15/21, 12:47 - Marco: Yeah
3/15/21, 12:47 - Marco: Idk if you're sarcastic or not with the pronoun anymore
3/15/21, 12:48 - Lorenzo: no
3/15/21, 12:48 - Lorenzo: I'm just using what they want to be pronounced as
3/15/21, 12:48 - Marco: Ok
3/15/21, 12:50 - Lorenzo: people who constantly are complaining about pronouns are people that are really bored
3/15/21, 12:50 - Marco: I'm not complaining about it
3/15/21, 12:50 - Lorenzo: I am not saying you are
3/15/21, 12:50 - Marco: I just really don't care, I'm not putting any gendering significance on pronouns I use for people
3/15/21, 12:50 - Marco: It's just a word
3/15/21, 12:51 - Lorenzo: yeah
3/15/21, 12:51 - Lorenzo: if people say like
3/15/21, 12:52 - Marco: Idempathy
3/15/21, 12:52 - Lorenzo: 'I would want to be pronounced as'
3/15/21, 12:52 - Lorenzo: 'ok
3/15/21, 12:52 - Lorenzo: good'
3/15/21, 12:52 - Lorenzo: whatever floats your fluidity
3/15/21, 12:53 - Marco: "You're not your identity" but then why does she state her pronouns as the first thing
3/15/21, 12:53 - Marco: Maybe I'm not seeing this right
3/15/21, 12:53 - Lorenzo: at least let them finish before you react
3/15/21, 12:54 - Marco: I'm not enough into the sexuality/gender discourse (yet) to really say something about it I feel
3/15/21, 12:55 - Lorenzo: they were still talking while you were saying this which puts me into a position that I can not really react because I am still listening to them
3/15/21, 13:00 - Lorenzo: I get you
3/15/21, 13:01 - Lorenzo: But I think the emotion takes over the conversation too much
3/15/21, 13:01 - Marco: Yeah i agree
3/15/21, 13:01 - Marco: But it's because I'm ignorant about it
3/15/21, 13:01 - Lorenzo: people are being pissed off
3/15/21, 13:01 - Marco: And I come from a background that is ignorant about it
3/15/21, 13:01 - Lorenzo: about that other people don't know this
3/15/21, 13:01 - Lorenzo: and then blame them
3/15/21, 13:01 - Marco: And this in my background is the normal reaction to this discourse
3/15/21, 13:01 - Lorenzo: rather than educating them
3/15/21, 13:01 - Marco: Yeah that's the consequence of ignorance
3/15/21, 13:02 - Lorenzo: When you fail they rejoice
When you fail they rejoice
Falling down is an accident
Staying down is a choice
3/15/21, 13:03 - Lorenzo: you could either say like
3/15/21, 13:03 - Lorenzo: I WILL NOT CHANGE
3/15/21, 13:03 - Lorenzo: instead of
3/15/21, 13:04 - Lorenzo: I want to learn
3/15/21, 13:04 - Marco: Yeah this is stubborn ignorance
3/15/21, 13:05 - Lorenzo: but these academic terms
3/15/21, 13:05 - Lorenzo: always feel like they are the wrong words for the right things
3/15/21, 13:05 - Lorenzo: because it feels like pseudo intellectualism
3/15/21, 13:06 - Marco: Why do people from our class push their own agenda in these qnas haha
3/15/21, 13:06 - Marco: Hahaha
3/15/21, 13:06 - Lorenzo: long long long looong queeeestion (bill wurtz vibe)
3/15/21, 13:06 - Marco: It feels like self-validation
3/15/21, 13:07 - Marco: Hahaha yeah

3/23/21, 10:56 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
3/23/21, 11:15 - Lorenzo: the reason I was pissed off yesterday was not that you guys were working on the greenscreen stuff. But the fact that things were discussed, chosen and decided and that it was presented to people online. That is what pissing me off slightly.
3/23/21, 11:15 - Lorenzo: But it doesn't surprise me, I'm just done with it and I'm just sayign yes and continueing
3/23/21, 11:15 - Lorenzo: I am beyond caring.
3/23/21, 11:16 - Marco: What was the alternative in your opinion?
3/23/21, 11:17 - Lorenzo: The alternative was to present ideas and give and receive feedback
3/23/21, 11:17 - Lorenzo: not to like

3/23/21, 11:19 - Lorenzo: I'm just gonna let the pissedoffness wave away and accept it
3/23/21, 11:19 - Marco: Uhm I think it is more nuanced than that but if you wanna keep this position that's fine
3/23/21, 11:19 - Lorenzo: yeah and the nuance was offline right haha
3/23/21, 11:19 - Lorenzo: that's kinda my point
3/23/21, 11:19 - Marco: No
3/23/21, 11:20 - Marco: We made groups for a reason, also what we presented online was of course open to feedback
3/23/21, 11:21 - Lorenzo: I know that, but I thought yesterday was about group stuff and finetuning, but diego wasn't there
3/23/21, 11:28 - Lorenzo: ooooooooooooooohwwweellllll

3/26/21, 08:54 - Lorenzo: pff it's such a hassle to collect parts for building a pc
3/26/21, 08:56 - Lorenzo: at some point I'm doubting whether or not to buy a prebuilt
3/26/21, 09:07 - Marco: <Media omitted>

3/26/21, 09:11 - Lorenzo: I fuckin hate what happened with the graphic cards :")
3/26/21, 09:11 - Lorenzo: the ones that already came out are now at least €1000 more expensive haha
3/26/21, 09:13 - Marco: Yeah it's a matter of patience
3/26/21, 09:13 - Lorenzo: and capitalism

3/26/21, 11:33 - Marco: i kno
3/26/21, 11:33 - Marco: but
3/26/21, 11:33 - Marco: janine didnt start it yet
3/26/21, 11:33 - Lorenzo: true
3/26/21, 11:33 - Lorenzo: just sending a reminder
3/26/21, 11:36 - Marco: lol speak of the devil
3/26/21, 12:05 - Marco: well maybe because you're never there
3/26/21, 12:06 - Lorenzo: partially
3/26/21, 12:06 - Lorenzo: but she's right
3/26/21, 12:06 - Lorenzo: you can't shame her for having her personality traits
3/26/21, 12:06 - Marco: you can make connections if you really want to
3/26/21, 12:06 - Marco: i'm not shaming
3/26/21, 12:06 - Marco: it's a statement of fact
3/26/21, 12:07 - Marco: she's never there, hence she doesn't feel very attached to it
3/26/21, 12:07 - Lorenzo: Yeah but I understand why
3/26/21, 12:07 - Lorenzo: some people are more about collabs and everything
3/26/21, 12:07 - Lorenzo: and she's not
3/26/21, 12:07 - Lorenzo: and that's more of her concern than you saying this
3/26/21, 12:08 - Marco: how come, she very often talks about collaborative projects and creating communities
3/26/21, 12:08 - Marco: what
3/26/21, 12:08 - Lorenzo: I just don't think your comment is justified haha
3/26/21, 12:08 - Lorenzo: so I basically disagree
3/26/21, 12:09 - Marco: uhm ok
3/26/21, 12:12 - Lorenzo: this is a meeting to speak up your concerns and your thoughts on kabk right
3/26/21, 12:12 - Lorenzo: I just feel that it's a bit unfair in this case, you are right about some things
3/26/21, 12:12 - Lorenzo: I just think it's a bit bluntly
3/26/21, 12:13 - Marco: yeah may be
3/26/21, 12:13 - Lorenzo: Wies' voice is annoying
3/26/21, 12:13 - Lorenzo: but still a voice
3/26/21, 12:14 - Lorenzo: even though she does different things and other views right haha
3/26/21, 12:14 - Lorenzo: dialogue over polarisation :p
3/26/21, 12:14 - Marco: my personal experience is that I suffer from strong social anxiety, I even take medication for it, but still I make connections if I want to, and that's because I try and participate in the school life in what I'm interested
3/26/21, 12:14 - Marco: She's very social as she said
3/26/21, 12:14 - Lorenzo: that's you
3/26/21, 12:14 - Marco: yes wait
3/26/21, 12:14 - Marco: let me finish
3/26/21, 12:14 - Lorenzo: you can't look in her head haha
3/26/21, 12:14 - Lorenzo: yes sorry
3/26/21, 12:15 - Marco: I'm not, I'm commenting what she said, which is "I am very social", and she is very often talks about fostering communities in her projects, and about working together and collectivities
3/26/21, 12:15 - Marco: Yet she is taking a critical stance on the way kabk community interacts yet she's there like 10% of the time
3/26/21, 12:16 - Marco: which makes me find her comment kinda hypocritical
3/26/21, 12:16 - Marco: this is my opinion, you may disagree ofc
3/26/21, 12:18 - Lorenzo: sometimes you get somewhere where you want to be but you just don't feel that you fit in, different way of working etc and I thin kthat's how wies feels this. She feels she wants to do this community but different I guess
3/26/21, 12:18 - Lorenzo: I understand your point
3/26/21, 12:18 - Lorenzo: and partially agree
3/26/21, 12:19 - Lorenzo: IMAGINE JOHAN BEING A COACH
3/26/21, 12:19 - Lorenzo: HAHA

3/28/21, 11:08 - Marco: But I didnt know what did she tell you
3/28/21, 11:08 - Marco: Also it's crazy that they still didnt send this fucking render
3/28/21, 11:08 - Marco: I'm sorry you felt like that thought
3/28/21, 11:09 - Lorenzo: it was really fucking rude
3/28/21, 11:09 - Marco: I was out of there mentally so I didn't really take the lead in saying 'so what is everyone here for"
3/28/21, 11:09 - Marco: Yeah can imagine
3/28/21, 11:09 - Lorenzo: yes I understand
3/28/21, 11:09 - Lorenzo: you just got your internship so you were up in the sky and released of the struggle
3/28/21, 11:09 - Marco: Lol yeah i was thinking about that the whole day also before

3/28/21, 11:10 - Lorenzo: and that was for the first time
3/28/21, 11:10 - Lorenzo: yeah the thing is
3/28/21, 11:10 - Marco: But also not very present to do something about it
3/28/21, 11:10 - Lorenzo: I want to mention it
3/28/21, 11:11 - Lorenzo: but at the same time I'm too sceptic
3/28/21, 11:11 - Marco: Wdym
3/28/21, 11:12 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
3/28/21, 11:14 - Marco: I don't think that you care to much, I think it's the rest that cares too little

7/7/21, 12:18 - Marco: Ahahaha nice
7/7/21, 12:19 - Lorenzo: concept of this project was that we blame the internet always but we never look at our own behaviour which is the supply which internet also reponds to with its demands - as in, yes Big Tech is to blame but we love to point fingers
7/7/21, 12:22 - Lorenzo: these are like 7 artworks in an overlooking artwork, it was quite difficult to find the right things for every sin but it worked out quite nicely
7/7/21, 18:22 - Lorenzo: https://www.instagram.com/p/CRB9BNnF19W/ :D weer een project afgerond

7/9/21, 09:49 - Lorenzo: I'm tired from walking and experiencing the grad expo
7/9/21, 09:50 - Lorenzo: I mean I'm not really bitter anymore about things, I learned some things at internship and  I had some great talks yesterday
7/9/21, 09:51 - Lorenzo: kinda cleared my thoughts in my talk with Simbu and opened up about how I felt before internship
7/9/21, 09:51 - Lorenzo: and not in the complaining voice clips as I sent to you but more kinda reflective hahaha
7/9/21, 09:52 - Lorenzo: I'm really trying to be lighter bout things and focus on KABK/imd stuff rather than to be annoyed all the time, but it wasn't weird considering everything that happened 😂
7/9/21, 09:53 - Marco: Truee
7/9/21, 09:53 - Marco: But for me it's really different

7/10/21, 14:20 - Lorenzo: I always thought him and them were listenable for certain type of mental state
7/10/21, 14:21 - Lorenzo: it's not an easy listen (for me)
7/10/21, 14:22 - Marco: Oooh
7/10/21, 14:23 - Marco: I don't think it says much, I stumbled upon kid a again and I didn't like it as a teenager but now I rediscovered how good it actually is

7/13/21, 10:25 - Lorenzo: I recall something from Geoffrey's class but that's already long time ago haha
7/13/21, 10:26 - Marco: <Media omitted>

7/13/21, 10:31 - Lorenzo: it's JENGA: Mental Health Tower edition
7/13/21, 10:31 - Lorenzo: with regular Jenga the bricks fall and you continue
7/13/21, 10:32 - Lorenzo: with budget cuts you bring damage and my question is what do you do with the shards
7/13/21, 10:32 - Lorenzo: the jenga blocks consists of multiple healthcare perspectives
7/13/21, 10:32 - Lorenzo: also if you steal this I will end you
7/13/21, 10:32 - Lorenzo: xxx
7/13/21, 10:33 - Marco: hahaha why would I
7/13/21, 10:33 - Lorenzo: idk
7/13/21, 10:33 - Lorenzo: polarisation
7/13/21, 10:34 - Lorenzo: So like client / psychiatry / health insurance / goverment campaigns / science (medication / laboratory) / etc
7/13/21, 10:34 - Marco: sounds good
7/13/21, 10:35 - Marco: there is a lot of institutions you could fit in there
7/13/21, 10:35 - Lorenzo: And instead of pointing fingers, be constructive and build a better mental health care system
7/13/21, 10:36 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
7/13/21, 10:36 - Lorenzo: I love the sterile / clinical aesthetic of it
7/13/21, 10:37 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
7/13/21, 10:39 - Lorenzo: all this time I have been doubting if I was learning and what I was learning was _good enough_ but making this and conceptually explaining it I see my intership was really about growing in concepts / think in new ways etc
7/13/21, 10:40 - Lorenzo: and this is so fuckin bright and colourful if you put it next to what I usually make 😂
7/13/21, 10:43 - Lorenzo: but will you be fully internalized this summer or only a bit longer
7/13/21, 11:22 - Lorenzo: ok I prefer the first method but how do I make it thicker
7/13/21, 11:23 - Marco: Once you've done the loft, turn it into an editable object, then go on surface selection from the left sidebar
7/13/21, 11:23 - Lorenzo: oh thanks
7/13/21, 11:24 - Marco: select a polygon on the surface and then press Ctrl+A
7/13/21, 11:24 - Marco: and then M+T
7/13/21, 11:24 - Marco: and then you can extrude it
7/13/21, 11:24 - Marco: make sure you have "create caps" ticked in the left bottom panel
7/13/21, 11:24 - Marco: right bottom i mean
7/13/21, 11:25 - Marco: tell me if you need vid
7/13/21, 11:30 - Lorenzo: thaaankss
7/13/21, 11:30 - Lorenzo: only one thing 😂
7/13/21, 11:31 - Lorenzo: the loft doesnt have a centered pivot
7/13/21, 11:31 - Marco: shouldn't matter for the extrusion
7/13/21, 11:31 - Lorenzo: nvm
7/13/21, 11:31 - Lorenzo: I fixed it before I had realized it XD
7/13/21, 11:31 - Marco: noice

7/13/21, 12:18 - Marco: It should be first m and then t
7/13/21, 12:18 - Marco: Not both at the same time
7/13/21, 12:45 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>

7/28/21, 16:00 - Marco: Yes!! Now on to brooklin nine nine
7/28/21, 16:00 - Lorenzo: a lot of people didn't see it because of it's quick post-office release
7/28/21, 16:00 - Marco: Can imagine, it is also not as good ofc
7/28/21, 16:00 - Lorenzo: it wasn't intended to be
7/28/21, 16:01 - Lorenzo: it has some other qualities and developed in other ways
7/28/21, 16:02 - Lorenzo: but there were a lot of great characters
7/28/21, 16:03 - Lorenzo: I loved all of them haha
7/28/21, 16:03 - Marco: Same hahaha
7/28/21, 16:03 - Lorenzo: BYEEEEE BYEEEEE

7/28/21, 16:03 - Marco: Chris Pratt is outstanding
7/28/21, 16:03 - Marco: I didn't believe he could be so hilarious

7/28/21, 16:04 - Marco: Even in the outtakes
7/28/21, 16:04 - Marco: Yee but she becomes more of a gimmick after a while
7/28/21, 16:04 - Lorenzo: mwa
7/28/21, 16:04 - Marco: I would have preferred a better carachter arc/evolution for her
7/28/21, 16:04 - Marco: Like what happened with ron
7/28/21, 16:04 - Lorenzo: her gimmick becomes personal after a while
7/28/21, 16:05 - Marco: I feel like with april they rushed everything and there was little for her to evolve into
7/28/21, 16:05 - Lorenzo: or maybe this is overthinking a character
7/28/21, 16:05 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
7/28/21, 16:05 - Lorenzo: IT'S ABOUT THE CONES
7/28/21, 16:06 - Marco: No just thinking
7/28/21, 16:06 - Marco: Ahahaha
7/28/21, 16:06 - Marco: He also had a super nice character arc
7/28/21, 16:06 - Lorenzo: but also Aziz is so good XD
7/28/21, 16:06 - Marco: From a awkward nerd to a cool nerd
7/28/21, 16:06 - Marco: Yes but he is better in the first seasons I feel
7/28/21, 16:06 - Marco: Then he has a bleak aura for some reason
7/28/21, 16:06 - Lorenzo: every time he's going to that company
7/28/21, 16:06 - Lorenzo: and then goes away again 😂
7/28/21, 16:06 - Marco: That is LITERALLY the best thing you could say
7/28/21, 16:07 - Marco: My favorite person in the whole world
7/28/21, 16:07 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
7/28/21, 16:07 - Marco: Ahahahaha

7/28/21, 16:08 - Marco: Ahahahahaha

8/12/21, 00:51 - Marco: Italians olive oil like they like their women
8/12/21, 00:51 - Marco: IN THE KITCHEN
8/12/21, 00:51 - Marco: jk
8/12/21, 00:52 - Marco: But also kind of a fact
8/12/21, 00:52 - Lorenzo: dutch fact:
8/12/21, 00:53 - Lorenzo: Dutch people go on holiday, complain about not getting a kroket / bitterbal / frikandel
8/12/21, 00:53 - Lorenzo: then go home because they want dutch food
8/12/21, 00:54 - Lorenzo: and then order chinese (which is mostly Indonesian food but people in restaurants think: 'fuck those dutchies let's take their money lol')
8/12/21, 00:54 - Marco: Or italian
8/12/21, 00:54 - Lorenzo: yeah in that case
8/12/21, 00:54 - Lorenzo: it's mostly turkish people hahaha
8/12/21, 00:55 - Marco: Also I'm pretty sure that you can get the equivalent of a kroket / bitterbal almost anywhere decently civilized
8/12/21, 00:55 - Marco: And frikandel is disgusting
8/12/21, 00:55 - Lorenzo: haahaha
8/12/21, 00:55 - Lorenzo: yea ofcourse
8/12/21, 00:55 - Marco: Maybe hot dog is the closest thing to it
8/12/21, 00:55 - Lorenzo: where's there is a dutch faveplace to go
8/12/21, 00:55 - Marco: Which is also disgusting
8/12/21, 00:56 - Lorenzo: there's a street with 'friet van piet'
8/12/21, 00:56 - Marco: Ahahahah
8/12/21, 00:56 - Marco: Piet patat
8/12/21, 00:56 - Marco: In the hague
8/12/21, 00:56 - Lorenzo: 'Potatoes from Pietato'
8/12/21, 00:56 - Marco: Zwarte patat
8/12/21, 00:56 - Lorenzo: yeah I remember that
8/12/21, 00:56 - Lorenzo: Jilbert and Pedro asked if I know this local the hague snackbar called
8/12/21, 00:56 - Lorenzo: Bram Ladage
8/12/21, 00:57 - Marco: It is rotterdamse no?
8/12/21, 00:57 - Lorenzo: and I said _yeah, it's pratically born in rotterdam near blaak market but sure enjoy it_
8/12/21, 00:57 - Lorenzo: XD
8/12/21, 00:57 - Marco: It is quite good, although my favorite one in the hague is another one
8/12/21, 00:57 - Marco: But they are somehow very different
8/12/21, 00:58 - Lorenzo: idk I only get a brammetje in roffa
8/12/21, 00:58 - Marco: And I understand why one would like either one over the other
8/12/21, 00:58 - Marco: Like bram ladage they clearly know how to make it almost perfect
8/12/21, 00:58 - Marco: It's really nicely dry frying
8/12/21, 00:58 - Marco: Not greasy at all
8/12/21, 00:58 - Marco: Which is rare
8/12/21, 00:58 - Lorenzo: yeahhh boyy
8/12/21, 00:59 - Lorenzo: it's fuckin delicacy actually
8/12/21, 00:59 - Lorenzo: haha
8/12/21, 00:59 - Marco: But there is this place in the hague that does them differently, I think many would argue that they are not nice either
8/12/21, 00:59 - Marco: Because they are very charged with flavor
8/12/21, 00:59 - Marco: And not as dry as bl
8/12/21, 00:59 - Marco: But very different, closer to Belgian fries perhaps
8/12/21, 00:59 - Lorenzo: aaah yes
8/12/21, 01:00 - Marco: They are like crack
8/12/21, 01:00 - Lorenzo: well I'm partially fat so I wouldn't mind anyhow lelele
8/12/21, 01:00 - Marco: When you come to dh you should try

8/27/21, 14:39 - Marco: So ridiculous

8/27/21, 14:47 - Lorenzo: https://www.ntr.nl/site/nieuws/College-Tour:-Daan%20Roosegaarde/167/
8/27/21, 14:47 - Lorenzo: Tijdens de opnames met Daan Roosegaarde afgelopen dinsdag besloot onze gast een 'pauze' in te lassen, na het zien van een korte bijdrage van Bob Ursem van de TU Delft over de Smog Free Tower. Ursem is ontevreden over zijn samenwerking met Daan Roosegaarde en voelt zich niet voldoende gerespecteerd als wetenschapper. Hij vindt dat Roosegaarde zich ten onrechte poneert als uitvinder van de Smog Free Tower.
Roosegaarde wilde aanvankelijk niet ingaan op de vraag die het filmpje opriep, namelijk: in hoeverre is een uitvinding aan één iemand toe te schrijven en doet dat er eigenlijk toe? Daan Roosegaarde kwam na 18 minuten terug, waarna de opname verder ging. Hij ging alsnog in op de uitspraken van Bob Ursem.
 
Tijdens de voorbereidingen van het gesprek met Daan Roosegaarde stuitte de redactie op een aantal vergelijkbare voorbeelden als dat van Ursem. Ook de mensen achter de Sustainable Dance Floor en de lichtgevende verf hebben kritiek op de manier waarop Roosegaarde zich in de media profileerde met die projecten. De redactie van College Tour vond het niet meer dan vanzelfsprekend om een van die opvattingen aan Roosegaarde zelf voor te leggen, zodat hij kon reageren op deze uitspraken.
8/27/21, 14:48 - Lorenzo: so he basically stole the idea of the smog tower
8/27/21, 14:48 - Lorenzo: of someone from TU Delft
8/27/21, 14:49 - Lorenzo: (allegedly)
8/27/21, 14:49 - Lorenzo: and someone asked him about the critique and was just annoyed and walked away
8/27/21, 14:49 - Lorenzo: and now he allegedly stole from Sarah's internship dude
8/27/21, 14:50 - Lorenzo: but it's also fuckin bullshit that this Studio Roosegaarde thing
8/27/21, 14:51 - Lorenzo: is a company surrounding his ego
8/27/21, 14:51 - Lorenzo: _he 'made'/'designed' it_
8/27/21, 14:51 - Lorenzo: instead of SR made it

9/3/21, 10:27 - Marco: It's really badly written imo
9/3/21, 10:27 - Lorenzo: the actress is actually cringey XD
9/3/21, 10:27 - Marco: Haha yeah but she is kind of a gimmick sometimes, like Aubrey in PandD

9/3/21, 10:31 - Lorenzo: you're not, you're just a spoiled art student with snob taste trying to present yourself as something you're not because you would want to be liked for who you appear to be instead of who you are
9/3/21, 10:31 - Lorenzo: everything is meaningless
9/3/21, 10:31 - Lorenzo: we all die at some point and we might as well have fun

9/6/21, 08:34 - Lorenzo: I mean I had a nice day because grandpa was with us
9/6/21, 08:35 - Lorenzo: he hadnt seen blijdorp since before 2001
9/6/21, 08:35 - Lorenzo: the concept of a zoo is 50/50
9/6/21, 08:36 - Lorenzo: 50 percent > Yes, conserving endangered specied
9/6/21, 08:36 - Lorenzo: 50 percent > prisoned beings
9/6/21, 08:36 - Lorenzo: for human entertainment
9/6/21, 08:39 - Marco: Yeah that's also how I feel about it
9/6/21, 08:39 - Marco: But more 25 / 75
9/6/21, 08:40 - Lorenzo: You're right
9/6/21, 08:40 - Marco: But I guess going with your grandpa biases the balance a bit haha
9/6/21, 08:40 - Lorenzo: Yes

9/6/21, 08:42 - Marco: Yes to a degree, but the principle is the same
9/6/21, 08:42 - Lorenzo: Human entertainment
9/6/21, 08:42 - Marco: Caged up so that humans can safely see
9/6/21, 08:42 - Marco: Yep
9/6/21, 08:42 - Marco: Although circuses are fucking hell
9/6/21, 08:42 - Lorenzo: Yes the cage of a zoo is more designed to its habitat
9/6/21, 08:43 - Marco: Yes
9/6/21, 08:43 - Lorenzo: But there's a lack of space
9/6/21, 08:43 - Lorenzo: Thanks

9/9/21, 12:31 - Lorenzo: but I will just continue because I'm not letting myself be blocked because she wants me to do stuff
9/9/21, 12:31 - Marco: that's the only way to succeed
9/9/21, 12:31 - Lorenzo: _like a year ago_

9/9/21, 13:45 - Marco: bruh
9/9/21, 13:45 - Marco: EVERYONE HERE IS DEPRESSED
9/9/21, 13:46 - Lorenzo: _We want to be loved for who we appear to be instead of who we are_
_So our real selves hide behind the pomp and the façade_
9/9/21, 13:47 - Marco: i'm having an extatic meal right now lol
9/9/21, 13:47 - Marco: literally hid my webcam to hide my enjoyment facial expressions

9/9/21, 13:53 - Lorenzo: also I think the matrix is funny
9/9/21, 13:53 - Lorenzo: a human / western concept in  the hollywood context
9/9/21, 13:53 - Marco: i quit weed so I already feel like I'm on adderall
9/9/21, 13:54 - Lorenzo: which makes the idea of a matrix ironic as hell
9/9/21, 13:55 - Lorenzo: _vibration, frequency, sound, really interesting_
9/9/21, 13:55 - Lorenzo: sounds like she wasn't paying attention haha

9/9/21, 20:45 - Lorenzo: Suddenly today I was really overwhelmed haha
9/9/21, 20:45 - Marco: i understand
9/9/21, 20:45 - Marco: I've also been really blagh this two days for some reason
9/9/21, 20:46 - Lorenzo: I think Florian's email caused the ignition
9/9/21, 20:46 - Lorenzo: Not that it was bad
9/9/21, 20:46 - Marco: but is something happening tomorrow with him?
9/9/21, 20:47 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
9/9/21, 20:47 - Marco: damn
9/9/21, 20:48 - Lorenzo: The session tomorrow part kinda confused me
9/9/21, 20:49 - Lorenzo: (I was kinda settled on ending this week today so the autistic feature of last minute change which I rarely have but still have kinda was)
9/9/21, 20:49 - Marco: u wanna switch with me?

9/10/21, 11:21 - Marco: ahahahha
9/10/21, 11:21 - Marco: becomes japanese
9/10/21, 11:21 - Marco: purpalebarglaru
9/10/21, 11:21 - Marco: i am a bit tense for florian's call
9/10/21, 11:22 - Lorenzo: same
9/10/21, 11:22 - Lorenzo: _The fear in his face when he realised he cannae say it_
9/10/21, 11:22 - Marco: ahahah
9/10/21, 11:25 - Lorenzo: I was tense yesterday and also slept like shit (also because of the weather, it's too humid for my taste)
9/10/21, 11:25 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
9/10/21, 11:26 - Lorenzo: But I kinda used the nervousity as energy to make a trello todo thingy
9/10/21, 11:27 - Marco: Goddamn
9/10/21, 11:28 - Lorenzo: it seems like more than it is (title of my sextape)
9/10/21, 11:29 - Marco: ahahahaha
9/10/21, 11:54 - Lorenzo: don't worry about it
9/10/21, 11:54 - Lorenzo: it's a great convo
9/10/21, 12:39 - Marco: it was
9/10/21, 12:50 - Lorenzo: also I'm mentally done with the week haha
9/10/21, 12:56 - Marco: Understandable
9/10/21, 12:56 - Marco: Not sure if I wanna see the new Matrix
9/10/21, 12:58 - Lorenzo: I'm gonna rewatch em some time in years
9/10/21, 12:59 - Lorenzo: but I don't believe in its methodology haha
9/10/21, 12:59 - Marco: what
9/10/21, 12:59 - Lorenzo: k;ljl
9/10/21, 13:00 - Lorenzo: it is supposed to very wake up the system and it's cool to think like that
9/10/21, 13:00 - Lorenzo: but the onlything it has really done is coming a internet term _redpilling_
9/10/21, 13:00 - Marco: I very much disagree
9/10/21, 13:00 - Lorenzo: rather than that it didn't mean that much other than popculture
9/10/21, 13:01 - Lorenzo: and idk this feels like beating of a dead horse which already bled to death during the sequels
9/10/21, 13:01 - Lorenzo: I enjoyed the universe idea but idk
9/10/21, 13:01 - Marco: yeah that's how I feel about the new one
9/10/21, 13:02 - Lorenzo: first film was great
9/10/21, 13:02 - Marco: yep
9/10/21, 13:02 - Lorenzo: second was cool but less interesting
9/10/21, 13:02 - Lorenzo: third one was meh
9/10/21, 13:02 - Lorenzo: I also enjoyed the animatrix and the games and such and how these were all different things
9/10/21, 13:03 - Marco: didnt play those
9/10/21, 13:03 - Lorenzo: idk I still feel like it's v for vendetta
9/10/21, 13:03 - Lorenzo: overproduced
9/10/21, 13:03 - Lorenzo: but
9/10/21, 13:03 - Lorenzo: really, one of the best things of the matrix were the soundtracks haha
9/10/21, 13:04 - Lorenzo: no there's more cool about it
9/10/21, 13:04 - Marco: yeah
9/10/21, 13:04 - Lorenzo: and interesting and it started alot of cool things
9/10/21, 13:04 - Marco: definitely
9/10/21, 13:05 - Lorenzo: but I just think in the narrative it wants to speak, it's ironic as fuck
9/10/21, 13:05 - Lorenzo: at some point it only became discussions like
9/10/21, 13:05 - Lorenzo: _No you're still in the system_ NO U
9/10/21, 13:06 - Lorenzo: as a battle of the spliffs emerged
9/10/21, 13:06 - Marco: I don't think that's the premise at all
9/10/21, 13:06 - Marco: you can't make of a film what the audience makes of it
9/10/21, 13:06 - Lorenzo: ofc not
9/10/21, 13:06 - Marco: yeah so all the discussions and the _redpilling_ stuff that came after it doesn't affect the film
9/10/21, 13:07 - Lorenzo: howdoesn't it
9/10/21, 13:07 - Lorenzo: I mean if that is so
9/10/21, 13:07 - Marco: it affects your view of the film if you let it
9/10/21, 13:07 - Marco: not the artwork itself
9/10/21, 13:07 - Lorenzo: then why is part 4 coming xd
9/10/21, 13:07 - Marco: cause of money, but you have the choice not to watch it
9/10/21, 13:07 - Marco: and consider the first film as-is
9/10/21, 13:07 - Marco: a film
9/10/21, 13:08 - Lorenzo: As is  a product of hollywood
9/10/21, 13:08 - Lorenzo: which is fine
9/10/21, 13:08 - Lorenzo: same goes for fight club haha
9/10/21, 13:08 - Lorenzo: it's all interesting
9/10/21, 13:08 - Lorenzo: and adds up to the narrative
9/10/21, 13:09 - Lorenzo: but idk sometimes I just see it as products rather than stories
9/10/21, 13:09 - Lorenzo: entertainment
9/10/21, 13:09 - Marco: most of what you consume is that
9/10/21, 13:09 - Lorenzo: yes
9/10/21, 13:09 - Marco: I don't think it's a relevant argument haha
9/10/21, 13:09 - Marco: sorry
9/10/21, 13:10 - Marco: the fact that it's a product doesn't necessarily diminish the quality, it is what it is and contextualized it is an incredible film
9/10/21, 13:10 - Lorenzo: what gives you the right to say that? :))
9/10/21, 13:10 - Marco: my opinion is that it is not a relevant argument
9/10/21, 13:10 - Marco: but clearly we dont think the same
9/10/21, 13:11 - Marco: but we think the same that they are beating a dead horse with the 4tg
9/10/21, 13:11 - Marco: 4th
9/10/21, 13:11 - Marco: and that sucks, like what they did with star wars
9/10/21, 13:11 - Lorenzo: that's why I liked the animanics  hahaha
9/10/21, 13:12 - Marco: animaniacs?
9/10/21, 13:12 - Lorenzo: https://youtu.be/Cro69GGaRHw
9/10/21, 13:13 - Lorenzo: animaniacs is also really hollywood hahaha
9/10/21, 13:14 - Marco: omg this is amazing hahaha
9/10/21, 13:14 - Lorenzo: https://youtu.be/9hX-ksOLYS4
9/10/21, 13:16 - Lorenzo: yeah so
9/10/21, 13:16 - Lorenzo: warner bros is known for
9/10/21, 13:16 - Lorenzo: Hannah Barbara-cartoons
9/10/21, 13:16 - Lorenzo: looney tunes
9/10/21, 13:17 - Lorenzo: which is already a reaction to disney
9/10/21, 13:17 - Lorenzo: but the animaniacs are the creatures that live in the hollywood space of warner bros
9/10/21, 13:18 - Lorenzo: bringing self aware things through humour that sometimes gets real haha
9/10/21, 13:19 - Lorenzo: https://youtu.be/YMfUSs25KTU
9/10/21, 13:23 - Lorenzo: the first animaniacs was in 93 or so
9/10/21, 13:23 - Lorenzo: https://youtu.be/whUOy_q7_vA last thing I share with ye about it
9/10/21, 13:26 - Lorenzo: but you know what, I'm gonna rethink my thoughts on the matrix and all, gonna watch them all at some point again
9/10/21, 13:42 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
9/10/21, 13:46 - Lorenzo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldbA86MZIJ0 it's not a difficult song but I just love the dynamic

9/10/21, 14:58 - Lorenzo: about the (neo)nazi networks that are currently rising
9/10/21, 15:02 - Lorenzo: they infiltrated these white supremacy / neofascist telegram/whatsapp groups
9/10/21, 15:02 - Lorenzo: it is such a bizarre phenomenon
9/10/21, 15:03 - Lorenzo: also linked to conspiracy things since those all connect to antisemitic fiction as The Protocols of the Elders of Zion
9/10/21, 15:06 - Lorenzo: such a fun way to start the wochenende
9/10/21, 15:12 - Marco: Yeah ahaha I thought you were done

9/12/21, 15:41 - Marco: Only now I am aligning myself with what I really like
9/12/21, 15:41 - Marco: A bit ashamed to show

9/15/21, 10:30 - Lorenzo: lolk
9/15/21, 11:52 - Lorenzo: I'm wondering if low self esteem could be a disability or the effect to or from a disability. The idea of comparing yourself to someone else as disabling you to live your life your way. 

I have been talked down on and laughed at. I'm feeling an inconstant battle of whether or not I mirror. These and more overthinkative thoughts are the result of people's words and remarks they might been forgetting the moment the air left the lip. 

On the one side what I then am expected to do is to M A N. U P.  Because vulnerability is often mistaken for a weakness rather than being in close contact with emotion. these kind of things could lead to a depression because the belittling things are seeds that could grow within brain cells and take over multiple every day function. I am to say that this on multiple levels make life unbearable and also the word my phone predicted: unbeatable. While typing this, I feel guilty because of the mental health taboo. Either being treated or being healed.. sigh, and then people are wondering why there is a mental health crisis. As if it isn't hard enough to admit this, the privatised healthcare in the oh so wealthy Netherlands I live has made it worse by neoliberal decisions in bureaucratic policy. And if that isn't enough, if you even dare take steps and do something about it. You need to pay own risk in order to speak the mind.

A while ago I asked on my Instagram what people in order to deal with mental health. 
The reactions were either waiting lists or alternative things: microdosing, shadow work, Ayahuasca, meditation. 

And that makes sense. If the medical western world can't provide it, get it somewhere else. There are studies taking place on alternatives. Treatment through ketamine, MDMA, cannabis etc
9/15/21, 11:53 - Lorenzo: sorry I needed to dump my phone thing somewhere

9/17/21, 19:02 - Lorenzo: if I was energized yes
9/17/21, 19:02 - Lorenzo: if I wanted to wear a mask
9/17/21, 19:02 - Lorenzo: yes
9/17/21, 19:02 - Marco: really ok
9/17/21, 19:02 - Lorenzo: if I felt like being sociodemic
9/17/21, 19:02 - Lorenzo: yes
9/17/21, 19:03 - Marco: I didn't know you were in such good relationship with the switches haha
9/17/21, 19:03 - Lorenzo: but I'm more like bar3
9/17/21, 19:03 - Lorenzo: is more about the global thing of kabk peeps
9/17/21, 19:04 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
9/17/21, 19:04 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
9/17/21, 19:07 - Marco: i was there
9/17/21, 19:07 - Marco: lol
9/17/21, 19:07 - Marco: kind of the reason why I don't want to go
9/17/21, 19:07 - Marco: there is this cultist trend which is getting scary tbh
9/17/21, 19:08 - Lorenzo: it's dumb
9/17/21, 19:08 - Marco: I feel uncomfortable in a context like that
9/17/21, 19:08 - Marco: not only it's dumb, to me it's kinda scary
9/17/21, 19:08 - Lorenzo: yes
9/17/21, 19:08 - Marco: like really when someone gets brainwashed by a cult you know, then they become sort of zombies
9/17/21, 19:08 - Lorenzo: like a spirit is not bullshit to me
9/17/21, 19:08 - Marco: with no critical thinking
9/17/21, 19:08 - Marco: it is kind of scary
9/17/21, 19:09 - Marco: no same
9/17/21, 19:09 - Marco: but the way they are approaching it is becoming exclusive and plain dumb
9/17/21, 19:09 - Marco: i don't like people who don't put themselves in discussion
9/17/21, 19:09 - Marco: or that just see their own view of things
9/17/21, 19:09 - Marco: and not the big picture
9/17/21, 19:10 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
9/17/21, 19:19 - Lorenzo: also I was really happy to see you again this week bby :$$$$$$$$$
9/17/21, 20:15 - Marco: Omg me tooo 😳😳😳
9/17/21, 20:15 - Marco: I had sent some messages from my laptop before but my phone died
9/17/21, 19:13 - Marco: yeah exactly. I also believe somewhat in this but as a base I always have healthy doubt because I know I am not made to truly KNOW these things, I can just suppose. But they really are drifting in a dogmatic realm, like literally "I wanna create a religion" is what they say blatantly and I don't understand how can they say something like that without thinking twice about what it means
9/17/21, 19:14 - Marco: And all the negativity that the concept of religion brings with itself. Even wies yesterday mentioned the same but I think she is a bit more (luckily) "clueless" about what she is saying and she is smart enough not to follow up in the same brainless way these cunts are doing
9/17/21, 20:57 - Marco: there it is
9/17/21, 20:58 - Lorenzo: Holy fuck
9/17/21, 20:59 - Lorenzo: Will read later

9/19/21, 10:15 - Marco: Damn if you've put in words anything there was to say about this lol

9/19/21, 10:31 - Lorenzo: INSIDE by him is so good
9/19/21, 10:31 - Marco: ye I heard that sort of everywhere haha
9/19/21, 10:31 - Lorenzo: haha well it's kind of a zeitgeist in a way
9/19/21, 10:31 - Marco: ye that's why I'll take my time to watch it
9/19/21, 10:31 - Lorenzo: I still want to watch it again
9/19/21, 10:32 - Lorenzo: but the funny and ironic part of it
9/19/21, 10:32 - Lorenzo: is that his songs are being used out of context on social media
9/19/21, 10:33 - Lorenzo: the song BEZOS is used as this 'look how I made it in career' while the song is a fake homage to the guy hahah
9/19/21, 10:33 - Lorenzo: same thing goes for welcome to the internet / white woman's instagram / etc
9/19/21, 10:34 - Marco: maybe I'll watch it this week
9/19/21, 10:34 - Lorenzo: have you seen the previous shows?
9/19/21, 10:35 - Lorenzo: it might be an idea to watch it from his first to the last one
9/19/21, 10:36 - Lorenzo: also a thing that is really typical about him is that he's a product the modern day society, he was 18 or something when he started his Youtube channel and now he just won this big award for INSIDE which is on netflix

9/19/21, 10:39 - Marco: like think about words that we think have to do with the thesis?
9/19/21, 10:39 - Marco: Great

9/22/21, 10:26 - Lorenzo: no he applied to work in the 3d workshop
9/22/21, 10:27 - Lorenzo: but wasn't chosen after two rounds because they wanted someone from another space than kabk or something
9/22/21, 10:27 - Marco: Waaah
9/22/21, 10:27 - Marco: Wack
9/22/21, 10:27 - Lorenzo: while he was in there for like 5 years or so
9/22/21, 10:27 - Marco: They have so many kabk students working in other workshops!!
9/22/21, 10:27 - Lorenzo: which is the perfect reason why they should hire him
9/22/21, 10:27 - Marco: What kind of criteria is that even
9/22/21, 10:28 - Marco: Yeah he's also reeeally good at that
9/22/21, 10:28 - Lorenzo: exactly
9/22/21, 10:28 - Marco: Fuckin kabk
9/22/21, 10:28 - Marco: He should protest
9/22/21, 10:28 - Marco: This is not a valid motive
9/22/21, 10:28 - Lorenzo: this is what I remember
9/22/21, 10:28 - Lorenzo: I might have ehm
9/22/21, 10:28 - Lorenzo: how you call it
9/22/21, 10:29 - Lorenzo: paraphrased it
9/22/21, 10:29 - Lorenzo: so some details might differ but in the bottom line he wasn't hired for stupid reasons
9/22/21, 10:30 - Marco: Crazy shit
9/22/21, 10:30 - Lorenzo: _The subject is 'Protest'. You can use the Dutch Institute for Sound and Vision’s open archive to create your own works around this urgent topic. https://www.openbeelden.nl/about_
9/22/21, 10:30 - Lorenzo: _The IMD focus will also highlight topics like deep-fake, memes and social media as a platform for protest._
9/22/21, 10:30 - Marco: Yeah I'll ask tomorrow if we can vote or make it not mandatory
9/22/21, 10:30 - Lorenzo: "and then we'll make NFT out it n_n"
9/22/21, 10:31 - Marco: Because I am not on board

9/22/21, 10:31 - Marco: Including a job
9/22/21, 10:31 - Lorenzo: "Commodify the livng shit out of it"
9/22/21, 10:33 - Lorenzo: yeah I agree with that
9/22/21, 10:34 - Lorenzo: we're really limited in our time
9/22/21, 10:34 - Lorenzo: very tight deadlines
9/22/21, 10:34 - Marco: Yep
9/22/21, 10:34 - Lorenzo: and an improv burstweek in other for the greater good of IMD rrather than students
9/22/21, 10:35 - Lorenzo: did you get anything from Living Lab as compensation or something
9/22/21, 10:36 - Lorenzo: another thing I'm not on board is the fact that I hear PiP more and more

9/22/21, 10:56 - Marco: I think a poll is quick enough
9/22/21, 10:57 - Lorenzo: true but the poll is also a bit more underbelly
9/22/21, 10:57 - Lorenzo: I get the poll idea but the rationality element of your argument is not in the poll
9/22/21, 10:58 - Marco: yeah the shoving it in my face I really dont like
9/22/21, 10:58 - Marco: Feel like i am not respected at all
9/22/21, 10:58 - Marco: it's not fucking basisschool
9/22/21, 10:58 - Lorenzo: which is why I said like communicate in a space where people speak their mind rather than frustration
9/22/21, 10:58 - Lorenzo: in a chat
9/22/21, 11:00 - Marco: I guess, I just want to asap tell them that there is doubts
9/22/21, 11:00 - Marco: And frustration
9/22/21, 11:00 - Lorenzo: I understand that and agree
9/22/21, 11:00 - Marco: Cause they are giving it for granted that we like this

9/22/21, 12:39 - Lorenzo: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LS7E2hzlUqnJ0zD09_0FjtuJ0bp7kD0mlOFJZkxy_R0/edit?usp=sharing
9/22/21, 12:40 - Marco: Nice that you make it visual
9/22/21, 12:43 - Lorenzo: thanks
9/22/21, 12:44 - Marco: Still havent done much for it
9/22/21, 12:44 - Marco: Like wrote 4 lines i am not sure about
9/22/21, 12:44 - Marco: Not sure if I'm gonna finish it today either
9/22/21, 12:44 - Lorenzo: yeah I had some talks with people and readsome things
9/22/21, 12:44 - Lorenzo: tthat's fine
9/22/21, 12:44 - Marco: Nice
9/22/21, 12:44 - Marco: Sorta
9/22/21, 12:45 - Lorenzo: https://youtu.be/_-WimRb2jXs
9/22/21, 12:46 - Lorenzo: what do you mean by
9/22/21, 12:47 - Lorenzo: made it visual
9/22/21, 12:48 - Marco: That there are images
9/22/21, 12:48 - Lorenzo: oh yes
9/22/21, 12:51 - Lorenzo: I think Ayishat Akanbi is one of the people who have inspired me the most this year
9/22/21, 12:51 - Lorenzo: https://youtu.be/N3ZjTg1OpIE
9/22/21, 12:58 - Marco: Nice I will read
9/22/21, 12:59 - Marco: It may be a topic that I touch too
9/22/21, 12:59 - Marco: Cause I wanna talk about the nurturing role of machines
9/22/21, 12:59 - Lorenzo: she is more a speaker in videos than she is a writer I think
9/22/21, 13:00 - Lorenzo: but she is very nuanced in conversation about harsh topics
9/22/21, 13:00 - Lorenzo: and that's kind of what I want to do in my thesis as well
9/22/21, 13:00 - Marco: Nuanced in what sense?
9/22/21, 13:00 - Lorenzo: because I'm talking about religion being at the table in Nederland BV
9/22/21, 13:01 - Lorenzo: and how does that have an impact on disability
9/22/21, 13:02 - Lorenzo: but at the same time I don't feel like being political correct all the time about it because critique is valid coming from all sides of the political spectrum when the argument makes sense
9/22/21, 13:02 - Lorenzo: and also what does it mean to be disabled in this context
9/22/21, 13:03 - Lorenzo: and how does it manifest itself, because the woke movement is sometimes gatekeeping this idea
9/22/21, 13:04 - Lorenzo: asin speaking up for a certain group of people is always good, but in our internet discussion age it is rather a popularity contest screaming the most ideologically
9/22/21, 13:05 - Lorenzo: to get them like and hearts as a result of virtue signalling
9/22/21, 13:06 - Marco: Please dont
9/22/21, 13:06 - Lorenzo: also art institutions do this
9/22/21, 13:06 - Lorenzo: anna does this
9/22/21, 13:08 - Marco: Anna does virtue signaling a LOT
9/22/21, 13:08 - Lorenzo: yes
9/22/21, 13:09 - Lorenzo: I talk with hannah a lot about this
9/22/21, 13:09 - Marco: Why hannah
9/22/21, 13:09 - Lorenzo: well the moment I had some certain idea about anna's bias and such
9/22/21, 13:10 - Lorenzo: she was like YES
9/22/21, 13:11 - Marco: Mh ok
9/22/21, 13:11 - Lorenzo: and I also really am feeling on the same level with her about this kind of topics
9/22/21, 13:13 - Lorenzo: kind of off topics but also not
9/22/21, 13:15 - Lorenzo: I had conversation with someone about woke as being capitalized
9/22/21, 13:16 - Lorenzo: and we talked about how beyonce and jay-z are an example in that
9/22/21, 13:19 - Lorenzo: the conversation started with astrology and at some point I said that an element  of the astrology hype in popculture also came when Beyoncé did the libra thing, and how she had/has this god status
9/22/21, 13:20 - Marco: <Media omitted>
9/22/21, 13:20 - Lorenzo: while she is also part of entertainment industry as capitalism
9/22/21, 13:20 - Lorenzo: with people suffering underneat her but that's a taboo to mention because YAAAAAAAAAAAAAS QUEEN GURL
9/22/21, 13:20 - Marco: I'm out of the loop
9/22/21, 13:20 - Lorenzo: that's ok
9/22/21, 13:21 - Lorenzo: I'm not really focused so more bloating than talking haha
9/22/21, 13:24 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
9/22/21, 13:28 - Marco: Precisely
9/22/21, 13:29 - Lorenzo: OMG
9/22/21, 13:29 - Lorenzo: I found out how to use magenta studio IN ableton
9/22/21, 13:30 - Lorenzo: used some random instruments and sounds but
9/22/21, 13:31 - Marco: Magenta studio is AI music daw?
9/22/21, 13:34 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>

9/22/21, 14:55 - Marco: Damn that was quick lol
9/22/21, 15:17 - Marco: It's so annoying how so many push their own desire for something while masking it as something good for everyone
9/22/21, 15:18 - Marco: As if people are stupid and not recognize it
9/22/21, 15:20 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
9/22/21, 15:21 - Marco: Ahahaha you should sample that laugh and add it

9/22/21, 15:30 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
9/22/21, 18:11 - Marco: Ooooh lovely we have an autumn break lol
9/22/21, 21:05 - Lorenzo: What
9/22/21, 21:05 - Lorenzo: Did they just plan
9/22/21, 21:06 - Marco: Idk I wasnt listening
9/22/21, 21:06 - Marco: What is written in the group is what was said
9/22/21, 21:12 - Lorenzo: Ok
9/22/21, 21:42 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
9/22/21, 21:48 - Marco: the "decisions are being made for me" kind of thing is the reason why I took it so seriously and asked people what they think
9/22/21, 21:48 - Marco: Because it is not good for anyone and don't worry, it's not gonna happen
9/22/21, 21:48 - Marco: we gon emancipate our selvez
9/22/21, 21:48 - Lorenzo: emancipate yourself from mental slavery
9/22/21, 21:49 - Lorenzo: none but ourselves can free our minds
9/22/21, 21:49 - Lorenzo: have no fear of atomic energy
9/22/21, 21:49 - Marco: Also don't take that party thing too seriously at all, it is just egocentric people trying to put up something to showcase their ego to everyone, don't even make it weight a bit in your everyday life
9/22/21, 21:49 - Lorenzo: cause none of them can stop the time haha
9/22/21, 21:49 - Marco: I don't even know if I'm gonna go
9/22/21, 21:49 - Marco: wat is deze
9/22/21, 21:49 - Lorenzo: Another day ie Lie MD
9/22/21, 21:49 - Marco: Speaking of the insecurity
9/22/21, 21:50 - Lorenzo: redemption song haha
9/22/21, 21:50 - Marco: I think you are on a very good track and you will find something that makes you feel more safe in what you are doing soon
9/22/21, 21:50 - Marco: It's 2 weeks in, no one expects you to be that far past point 0
9/22/21, 21:51 - Lorenzo: could we crucify the person that calls himself the bringer of light
9/22/21, 21:51 - Marco: So don't stress too much, look at what you are accomplishing and take a rest if needed
9/22/21, 21:51 - Marco: They did that once and it made things worse
9/22/21, 21:51 - Marco: So I'll leave it as is
9/22/21, 21:51 - Lorenzo: All of us serve the same masters, all of us nothin' but slaves
Never forget in the story of Jesus, the hero was killed by the state
9/22/21, 21:52 - Marco: still redemption song?
9/22/21, 21:52 - Lorenzo: no
9/22/21, 21:52 - Lorenzo: walking in the snow

9/22/21, 22:19 - Lorenzo: I have reached a certain state of autonomy awareness I feel like
9/22/21, 22:20 - Lorenzo: I feel a bit better now tho thnx
9/22/21, 22:20 - Lorenzo: because the thing is about my thoughts and criticism
9/22/21, 22:20 - Lorenzo: I know that I'm right about it as well and that makes it worse 😂
9/22/21, 22:26 - Marco: yes but try not to let these things that are out of your control affect you to much
9/22/21, 22:26 - Marco: stand your ground and opt out if you feel like it's too much
9/22/21, 22:26 - Lorenzo: hahaha
9/22/21, 22:26 - Marco: STAND YOUR GROUND
9/22/21, 22:26 - Lorenzo: afzondering ❤️

9/22/21, 22:31 - Lorenzo: one of my fave songs by them
9/22/21, 22:31 - Lorenzo: "I'm only waiting for the proper time to tell you
That it's impossible to get along with you
It's hard to look you in the face when we are talking
So it helps to have a mirror in the room

I've not been really looking forward to the performance
But there's my cue and there's a question on your face
Fortunately I have come across an answer
Which is go away and do not leave a trace"
9/22/21, 22:34 - Lorenzo: sorry I have been wrong in my commentary
9/22/21, 22:35 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>

9/27/21, 21:07 - Lorenzo: but I'm for some reason longing for a 9 to 5 design/editor kind of job
9/27/21, 21:08 - Lorenzo: choosing financial stability over MaKiNg It In ThE ArTwOrLd
9/27/21, 21:08 - Marco: Trust me it's better than the romanticized idea of an artist makes it to be
9/27/21, 21:08 - Lorenzo: since that is also crooked
9/27/21, 21:08 - Lorenzo: yeah and I also don't want to join in the oppression olympics
9/27/21, 21:09 - Marco: Which is?
9/27/21, 21:09 - Lorenzo: haha it's a term I know by Ayishat Akanbi

9/27/21, 21:12 - Marco: ye
9/27/21, 21:12 - Marco: what can i watch now that i finished b99 lol
9/27/21, 21:14 - Lorenzo: new girl
9/27/21, 21:14 - Marco: Ok
9/27/21, 21:14 - Lorenzo: modern family
9/27/21, 21:15 - Marco: those were actually my two choices
9/27/21, 21:15 - Marco: together with a good place
9/27/21, 21:15 - Lorenzo: The Good Place also real noice
9/27/21, 21:15 - Marco: which one of the three do you recommend
9/27/21, 21:15 - Lorenzo: eeehmm
9/27/21, 21:16 - Lorenzo: if you want a quirky friend kind of vibe > new girl 
if you want feel good famiily funny vibes > modern family 
if you want a lightheaded introduction  to moral philosophy and learn a bit next to laughing > the good place
9/27/21, 21:17 - Lorenzo: they're all good
9/27/21, 21:17 - Lorenzo: but new girl and modern familiy go more into the regular sitcom
9/27/21, 21:17 - Lorenzo: the good place is different imo
9/27/21, 21:19 - Marco: good place it is then
9/27/21, 21:19 - Lorenzo: modern family and new girl are also lowr in effort
9/27/21, 21:20 - Lorenzo: asin you can lie on the couch and absorb the episodes
9/27/21, 21:20 - Lorenzo: the first time I got to know the good place was while looking at a talkshow
9/27/21, 21:20 - Marco: ye i would like that but I also want to learn something
9/27/21, 21:21 - Lorenzo: and they show a fragment about how the trolly problem works (or doesn't)
9/27/21, 21:21 - Lorenzo: and that got me into watching it
9/27/21, 21:22 - Marco: interesting
9/27/21, 21:24 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
9/27/21, 21:29 - Lorenzo: I'm currently watching something called dream school
9/27/21, 21:29 - Lorenzo: which is with people who had a rough life  and which affects their lives
9/27/21, 21:30 - Lorenzo: and this dream school concept is about finding what they want to do and also trying to quite some bad behavior
9/27/21, 21:30 - Lorenzo: very interesting
9/27/21, 21:37 - Marco: How is everything that Micheal Schur touch turns to gold

9/27/21, 22:14 - Marco: Sounds cool
9/27/21, 22:14 - Marco: Vexillology is a cool subject
9/27/21, 22:15 - Lorenzo: yeah I said I'll come back to it when my mind is in a better place
9/27/21, 22:15 - Lorenzo: true but it might be a bit more commercially aimed
9/27/21, 22:20 - Lorenzo: oh btw
9/27/21, 22:20 - Lorenzo: I talked about Sunn O)))
9/27/21, 22:20 - Lorenzo: it's drone metal haha

10/1/21, 12:01 - Marco: I'm also investigating invisible structures a lot
10/1/21, 12:02 - Marco: But not aimed to the netherlands
10/1/21, 12:02 - Marco: I recommend you see this
10/1/21, 12:08 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
10/1/21, 12:08 - Lorenzo: can you tell the concept behind it
10/1/21, 12:09 - Lorenzo: because I'm not sure if I'm reading it correctly
10/1/21, 12:10 - Lorenzo: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LS7E2hzlUqnJ0zD09_0FjtuJ0bp7kD0mlOFJZkxy_R0/edit check my updated version
10/1/21, 12:17 - Marco: I guess it highlights the stereotypes that people have about each part of amsterdam
10/1/21, 12:17 - Lorenzo: it's also about other parts of nl
10/1/21, 12:18 - Marco: Yeah
10/1/21, 12:18 - Lorenzo: It's way more interesting to look outside of the randstad aswell
10/1/21, 12:18 - Marco: Yep
10/1/21, 12:19 - Lorenzo: also the things that I see about my beloved roffa is known xd
10/1/21, 12:19 - Lorenzo: those are not stereotypes hahaha
10/1/21, 12:19 - Marco: Yeah i mean
10/1/21, 12:19 - Marco: You understand what it is
10/1/21, 12:19 - Lorenzo: yeah I geit it
10/1/21, 12:19 - Lorenzo: it feels like the dutch map meme
10/1/21, 12:20 - Marco: Pretty much
10/1/21, 12:20 - Marco: Pretty map
10/1/21, 12:21 - Lorenzo: but for my thesis I'm also looking at the word of society which in dutch has the word maatschap
10/1/21, 12:21 - Lorenzo: maatschappij
10/1/21, 12:22 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
10/1/21, 12:22 - Lorenzo: 2/4 are about human and 2/4 are about economics
10/1/21, 12:22 - Lorenzo: so even the translation of the word already has economic value
10/1/21, 12:24 - Lorenzo: also like the word of
10/1/21, 12:26 - Lorenzo: wellfare in dutch = welvaart 
_GUNSTIGE TOESTAND WAARIN IEMAND VERKEERT_ =  
favorable status where one is in -> yet verkeert also derives from verkeer = traffic
10/1/21, 12:26 - Lorenzo: I'm getting a lot of stuff confirmed that it freaks me out because I feel like a conspiracy nutter when reading this as
10/1/21, 12:29 - Lorenzo: so for instance if the Netherlands is a company > the stakeholders then are multinational companies, religious institutions, formerslave owners  etc (this is a guess not a conclusion)
10/1/21, 13:00 - Marco: Ahahah it has that vibe indeed
10/1/21, 13:04 - Lorenzo: yeah
10/1/21, 13:06 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
10/1/21, 13:51 - Lorenzo: and now I'm out of energy 😂

10/2/21, 07:55 - Lorenzo: What was the premise again
10/2/21, 07:55 - Lorenzo: I don't want to accidentally give spoilers
10/2/21, 10:15 - Marco: The whole first season is about that place being the good place
10/2/21, 10:16 - Marco: But the season finale reveals that it is actually the bad place and Micheal is the master planner of that torture machine
10/2/21, 10:16 - Lorenzo: hahaha oh yeah
10/2/21, 10:16 - Marco: He is also a really great charachter portrayed by a great actor
10/2/21, 10:16 - Lorenzo: I'vee the good place 3x
10/2/21, 10:16 - Lorenzo: It's a great cast in general
10/2/21, 10:17 - Lorenzo: but he has a lot of experience
10/2/21, 10:17 - Marco: That sudden change in personality when he gets exposed is 🤌😘
10/2/21, 10:18 - Lorenzo: yeah
10/2/21, 10:19 - Lorenzo: But don't hold on to that security

10/2/21, 10:20 - Lorenzo: gave a truman vibe in the season finale as well
10/2/21, 10:20 - Marco: There is a micro-cameo when they show Jackson's friend while they try to rob the fast-food, when they hide Jackson in the safe
10/2/21, 10:20 - Marco: The safe says "Swanson safe company"
10/2/21, 10:20 - Marco: Yeah so much!!!
10/2/21, 10:20 - Lorenzo: HAHA OH YEAH

10/2/21, 10:21 - Lorenzo: he is amazing
10/2/21, 10:21 - Marco: Ahahaha yeah
10/2/21, 10:21 - Marco: I love that before they reset them at the end of the second season
10/2/21, 10:22 - Marco: It's "ya basi-"
10/2/21, 10:22 - Lorenzo: it gives a new standard
10/2/21, 10:22 - Lorenzo: to the idea of a sitcom
10/2/21, 10:22 - Marco: For sure
10/2/21, 10:22 - Marco: Yeah you are left with a feeling of uneasiness that there must be something wrong but the act is so good and goes on for so long that you forget about it
10/2/21, 10:23 - Marco: Until that cathartic point at the end, soo well written
10/2/21, 10:23 - Marco: Very ambitious compared to the other ones by Schur, but hell if it's well written
10/2/21, 10:23 - Lorenzo: I now wanna watch it again too hahaha
10/2/21, 10:24 - Lorenzo: I love how the series is about moral philosopy and at some point it comes YA BASIC again
10/2/21, 10:24 - Marco: Ahahah yeah
10/2/21, 10:24 - Lorenzo: makes it human
10/2/21, 10:24 - Marco: True true
10/2/21, 10:24 - Lorenzo: or humanist in a way
10/2/21, 10:25 - Marco: The premise of the charachter is amazing too
10/2/21, 10:25 - Marco: Like chidi especially
10/2/21, 10:25 - Marco: Being a professor in ethics doesnt make you an ethical person
10/2/21, 10:25 - Lorenzo: CHIDA ANAGONYE ❤️
10/2/21, 10:25 - Marco: Ahahah
10/2/21, 10:25 - Lorenzo: I love him
10/2/21, 10:26 - Lorenzo: his belly ache is such a great metaphor for the things he discusses
10/2/21, 10:27 - Lorenzo: hey but
10/2/21, 10:27 - Lorenzo: I haven't heard you about Tahani yet
10/2/21, 10:27 - Lorenzo: (Jameela Jamil ❤️)
10/2/21, 10:27 - Marco: Ahahah she is also a great charachter but I feel like there's more to her that still hasn't been revealed
10/2/21, 10:28 - Lorenzo: oh
10/2/21, 10:28 - Lorenzo: ye
10/2/21, 10:28 - Lorenzo: that's true
10/2/21, 10:28 - Lorenzo: I follow her on instagram and she has a lot of great topics she discusses
10/2/21, 10:28 - Marco: That her motivations were corrupt was clear from the start
10/2/21, 10:28 - Marco: Maybe she was the big manifestation that something was not quite right in the "fake good place"
10/2/21, 10:29 - Marco: Ooh really
10/2/21, 10:29 - Marco: I will check
10/2/21, 10:29 - Lorenzo: Do that after watching more
10/2/21, 10:29 - Marco: Ok ahah smart
10/2/21, 10:33 - Lorenzo: <Media omitted>
10/2/21, 10:38 - Marco: Oh yeah i remember this person
10/2/21, 10:38 - Marco: I think you talked about it already
10/2/21, 10:39 - Lorenzo: pre-covid she was great person
10/2/21, 10:39 - Lorenzo: during covid she decided to be a dick
10/2/21, 10:40 - Marco: I understand
10/2/21, 10:40 - Marco: Weird shift
10/2/21, 10:41 - Lorenzo: But I have known her too long so I was kinda conflicted about this
10/2/21, 10:41 - Marco: Yeah i understand but people change and it's ok to keep the distance if you feel like they don't reflect your values anymore
10/2/21, 10:41 - Lorenzo: exactly
10/2/21, 10:41 - Lorenzo: and like when I see her again I don't want to have any negative load on it
10/2/21, 10:41 - Marco: I did that earlier this year
10/2/21, 10:42 - Lorenzo: so that's why I said that I couldn't come because graduation is taking over my life
10/2/21, 10:42 - Lorenzo: (which is not completely true but she doesn't have to know yet)
10/2/21, 10:43 - Marco: Yeah I understand
10/2/21, 10:43 - Marco: But it is better to take distance and then see her again without any grudges
10/2/21, 10:43 - Lorenzo: THANK YOU
